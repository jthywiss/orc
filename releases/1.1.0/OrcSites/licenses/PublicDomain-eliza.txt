I wrote this to help learn Java. You are welcome to make use of it however you
want. This version is a reworking of a program I wrote back in 1983 to teach
myself how to use the Macintosh. I had written some really good documentation
at that time, explaining how to write your own scripts. For now, you can look
at Weizenbaum's article and the script I have provided to see how to write
scripts.
