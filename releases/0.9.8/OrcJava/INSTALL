User Installation Instructions
------------------------------

Most users will just want to use the orc JAR to run programs from the command
line.  Assuming you downloaded (for example) orc-0.9.1.jar, run at the command
line:

  java -jar orc-0.9.1.jar -help
  
to see command-line options.

There are a variety of sample programs in examples/.

Refer to the User's Guide in doc/userguide.pdf for more details of the Orc
language.

Developer Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------

If you plan to develop Orc within Eclipse, place the Orc JAR file on your
project's classpath.
