      <title><code>def class</code>: Define Site in Orc</title>
      
      <para>
      The <code>def class</code> declaration provides the capability to implement 
      <link linkend="ref.sites">sites</link> within Orc itself.
      It is syntactically similar to the <link linkend="ref.declarations.def"><code>def</code> declaration</link>, but serves a different purpose. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
      The body of a <code>def class</code> consists of a sequence of declarations followed by a 
      <indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>goal expression</primary></indexterm><firstterm baseform="goal expression">goal</firstterm> expression. Each <code>def</code> or
			<code>def class</code> declaration in this sequence is called a <indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>method</primary></indexterm><firstterm>method</firstterm>.     
      </para>
      
      <para>
      </para>
      
      <para>
      Orc's <code>def class</code> provides encapsulation in a manner similar to classes in object-oriented
      languages. In addition to colocating methods and the shared resources on which they operate,
      an Orc class may also encapsulate some computation via the goal expression, colocating methods 
      and resources with some orchestration which manages or monitors those resources.  
      </para>

	  <title>Creating Instances</title>
	  
	  <para>
	  A <code>def class</code> declaration binds its identifier to a new site, which we call an Orc class. 
	  When this site is called, it creates and <link linkend="ref.concepts.publish">publishes</link> an <indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>instance</primary></indexterm><firstterm>instance</firstterm>, 
	  a site which has all of the methods defined in the class.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	  In parallel, execution of the goal expression begins. 
	  Any value published by the goal expression is discarded. 
	  The class is a site, meaning that the execution of the goal expression cannot be <link linkend="ref.concepts.states.kill">killed</link> by Orc; 
	  it continues independently of the rest of the program.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	  When an instance is created, each <link linkend="ref.declarations.val"><code>val</code> declaration</link> begins to execute, 
	  and each method is captured as a <link linkend="ref.data.closure">closure</link>.
	  This has two important implications:
	  
	  <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>
        Different instances will have different values for each <code>val</code> declaration,
        created by separate computations, and these bindings are captured by the method closures.
        In particular, this means that an instance could create some <link linkend="ref.data.mutable">mutable resource</link>, such as
        a mutable cell or a semaphore, which is then manipulated by the methods; different
        instances will have different underlying mutable resources. Instances are thus very similar 
        to objects in object-oriented languages, and <code>val</code> declarations are analogous to
        private fields.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        Recall that creation of a closure is strict in the closure's free variables. Thus,
        the creation of the instance may block on some free variable within the class (i.e.
        a variable bound by <code>val</code>), or a free variable in the scope of the class.
        In practice, this means that instance creation will block on every <code>val</code>
        declaration whose name is mentioned in any method. Furthermore, the goal expression
        might begin executing even before the instance is published.
      </para></listitem>

	  <section xml:id="ref.declarations.defclass.methods">
	  <title>Calling Methods</title>
	  
	  <para>
	  Each instance returned by a call to the class has a method for each <code>def</code> or <code>def class</code>
	  declaration in the class body. A method is accessed using a <link linkend="ref.expressions.dot">dot access</link>;
	  the identifier name of the declaration is used as the key. When a method is called, the corresponding definition
	  executes.
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	  Each method behaves as a site, in particular a <link linkend="ref.concepts.helpful">helpful</link> site. Therefore,
	  
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem><para>
	      A method call, unlike a <link linkend="ref.expressions.call.function">function call</link>, is strict in all of its arguments.
	    </para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>
        A method call publishes at most one value. If the method is a <code>def</code>, its first publication
        is used, and execution of the body continues, but subsequent publications are ignored.   
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        If the method is a <code>def</code>, and execution of its body expression <link linkend="ref.concepts.states.halt">halts</link> <link linkend="ref.concepts.silent">silently</link>,
        then the method call also halts silently, exactly like a helpful site.   
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        A method call cannot be <indexterm><primary>kill</primary></indexterm><link linkend="ref.concepts.states.kill">killed</link> by the pruning combinator.
        Once the method has been called, its execution continues independently of the rest of the Orc program. 
      </para></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  </para>
	  
	  <para>
	    The <indexterm><primary>method</primary></indexterm>methods of an instance may be executed concurrently through concurrent invocations;
	    there is no synchronization or serialization mechanism to prevent this. Different calls to the same
	    method may even execute concurrently with each other.
	    If any method uses a shared resource, care must be taken to ensure that different method invocations
	    do not interfere with each other in unexpected ways.

	    <para>
	      A <code>def class</code> declaration is typechecked in the same way as a <code>def</code> declaration, with one exception.
