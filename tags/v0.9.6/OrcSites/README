This package includes assorted useful sites for Orc.
See the Javadoc for more information.

Example programs using these sites are in examples/

Using the JAR
-------------

To use the JAR, just include it in your classpath when
running Orc.  Because of some weirdness with the classloader,
if you want to use the include files which declare the sites
in this package, you should not run orc with the "-jar" option.
Instead, run programs manually with the orc.Orc class, for example:

java -cp orc-sites-0.9.2.jar:orc-0.9.2.jar orc.Orc examples/eliza.orc

Building the JAR
----------------

For a source build, you need to have OrcJava open in
your Eclipse workspace.
