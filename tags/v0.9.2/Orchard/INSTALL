To build this package from source, you will need
the OrcJava and OrcSites projects in Eclipse.

Do a "Clean" build and then use the External Tool "Build WAR"
to create a WAR file. This should be deployed to the "/orchard"
context on your servlet container.

Go to e.g. http://localhost:8080/orchard to test.
