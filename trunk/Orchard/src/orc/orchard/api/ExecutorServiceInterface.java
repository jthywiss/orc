/**
 * Broker used to create and manage running jobs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of a job:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Client calls compile to get a job ID.
 * <li>Client calls jobStart to start the job.
 * <li>In a loop,
 * <ol>
 * <li>Client calls jobEvents to get publications.
 * <li>Client calls purgeJobEvents to clear the publication buffer.
 * </ol>
 * <li>Client may call haltJob to force the job to end.
 * <li>Job finishes.
 * <li>Client calls finishJob to clean up the job.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that the job publication buffer has a fixed size, so if you don't call
 * purgeJobEvents regularly your job will be suspended when the buffer fills.
 * 
 *  * 
 * <p>
 * Originally the executor only allow clients to create jobs and clients had to
 * use a separate service to manage running jobs. This did make the interfaces
 * cleaner and required fewer arguments, but it created a lot of extra work for
 * both the client and the server, so I combined the services. Some examples of
 * the "extra work" (mostly caused by limitations of the Java web services and
 * servlet environments):
 * <ul>
 * <li>Clients must support dynamically-generated web service proxies. (This is
 * really the killer issue, since some platforms like Java make this hard).
 * <li>It's awkward to pass information between the executor and job services.
 * It requires an out-of-band channel.
 * <li>It requires context to be encoded in the URL, which may not be practical
 * for some services. In RPC-style services it's best if all context is passed
 * explicitly as arguments.
 * <li>Building job URLs requires knowledge about the protocol, so it creates
 * a lot more work to build a new protocol front-end.
 * </ul>
