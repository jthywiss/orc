/**
 * J2se6HttpServerSPI
 * <p>
 * The JAX-WS 2.x reference implementation (aka Metro, included in J2SE 6) ships with an embedded web server that handles Endpoint publishing. This web server can be replaced by Jetty thanks to the contributed Java HTTP Server SPI implementation.
 * <p>
 * This extension has been written not only to workaround the internal Sun HttpServer problem (http://forums.java.net/jive/message.jspa?messageID=130831) but also to allow tight integration of JAX-WS web services and servlets.
 * <p>
 * http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/J2se6HttpServerSPI
 * <p>
 * From Jetty contrib repository, version 6.1.19: 
 * http://svn.codehaus.org/jetty-contrib/jetty/tags/jetty-contrib-6.1.19/contrib/j2se6
