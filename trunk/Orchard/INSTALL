BEFORE BUILDING

To build this package from source, you will need the OrcJava, OrcSites,
and Website projects in Eclipse.

You will also need "orchard.properties" and "oauth.jks" files in the Orchard
project directory.  These are installation-specific, and contain some security-
sensitive data, so they are not provided in the distribution.  A
"sample.orchard.properties" is provided to get you started.  "oath.jks"
is your OAuth Java keystore.


TO BUILD THE MAC OS X STANDALONE DEMO APPLICATION

Do a "clean" build and then use the Ant target "demo-app" to build a
.tgz (gzip'ed tar) archive of the application.

Un-archive and run the Orchard Mac OS X app, and it will open your
default browser to a demo page running in an an embedded HTTP/servlet
server on your workstation, port 8080.


TO BUILD THE JAR'ED STANDALONE DEMO APPLICATION/SERVLETS

Do a "clean" build and then use the Ant target "demo-jar" to build a
JAR file of the application.

Run the orc.OrchardDemo class, with the command:

    java -jar orchard-1.0.0-demo.jar

This will open your default browser to a demo page running in an an
embedded HTTP/servlet server on your workstation, port 8080.

Alternatively, you can run the class orc.Orchard, with:

    java -jar orchard-1.0.0-demo.jar Orchard

and it will run as a standalone Orchard Web application (servlet) in
an embedded HTTP/servlet server on your workstation, port 8081.


TO BUILD THE WAR (WEB APPLICATION ARCHIVE)

Do a "clean" build and then use the Ant target "war" to build a
WAR file of the Orchard servlets and supporting libraries.

This should be deployed on a servlet 2.5+ container of your choosing.
