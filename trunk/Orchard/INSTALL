BUILDING, INSTALLING, AND RUNNING ORCHARD
-----------------------------------------

BEFORE BUILDING

To build this package from source, you will need the OrcJava, OrcSites,
and Website projects in Eclipse.

You will also need "orchard.properties" and "oauth.jks" files in the Orchard
project directory.  These are installation-specific, and contain some security-
sensitive data, so they are not provided in the distribution.  A
"sample.orchard.properties" is provided to get you started.  "oath.jks"
is your OAuth Java keystore.


TO BUILD & RUN THE MAC OS X STANDALONE DEMO APPLICATION

Do a "clean" build and then use the Ant target "demo-app" to build a
.tgz (gzip'ed tar) archive of the application.

Un-archive and run the Orchard Mac OS X app, and it will open your
default browser to a demo page running in an an embedded HTTP/servlet
server on your workstation, port 8080.


TO BUILD & RUN THE JAR'ED STANDALONE DEMO APPLICATION/SERVLETS

Do a "clean" build and then use the Ant target "zip" to build a
ZIP archive of the application with its required libraries.

Unpack the ZIP in the location of you choice.

Run the orc.OrchardDemo class, with the command:

    java -cp <path-to-Orc>/orc-2.0.2.jar:<path-to-Orc>/lib/\*:<path-to-OrcSites>/orc-sites-2.0.2.jar:<path-to-OrcSites>/lib/\*:orchard-2.0.2-demo.jar:lib/\* orc.OrchardDemo

This will open your default browser to a demo page running in an an
embedded HTTP/servlet server on your workstation, port 8080.

Alternatively, you can run the class orc.Orchard, with:

    java -cp <path-to-Orc>/orc-2.0.2.jar:<path-to-Orc>/lib/\*:<path-to-OrcSites>/orc-sites-2.0.2.jar:<path-to-OrcSites>/lib/\*:orchard-2.0.2-demo.jar:lib/\* orc.Orchard

and it will run as a standalone Orchard Web application (servlet) in
an embedded HTTP/servlet server on your workstation, port 8081.


TO BUILD & DEPLOY THE WAR (WEB APPLICATION ARCHIVE)

Do a "clean" build and then use the Ant target "zip" to build a
ZIP archive of WAR file of the Orchard servlets and supporting
libraries.

The contents of this archive should be deployed on a servlet 2.5+
container of your choosing.

Note: You will need to tell your JAX-WS implementation and servlet
      container to use the same HTTP server.  For Jetty, you'll
      need the J2SE6 module (see note below), and add the following to
      the Configure Server element of jetty.xml: 

    <!-- Use Jetty as Java 6 HTTP server provider - JAX-WS uses this for Endpoint publishing -->
    <Call class="org.mortbay.jetty.j2se6.JettyHttpServerProvider" name="setServer">
        <Arg><Ref id="Server"/></Arg>
    </Call>

Note: The J2SE6 module is found in Jetty's contrib directory. Do not
      use a J2SE6 version after 6.1.20 -- the code was mangled in .21
      and still is in .22.  (Later versions of Jetty itself are OK.)
      There's a Jetty 7 equivalent, the "j2sehttpspi" module, but I
      haven't tried it yet.

      We've also included a subset of Jetty and its J2SE6 module in the
      ZIP archive.

Logging, for Jetty:  Orc and Orchard use java.util.logging, and Jetty
has its own org.mortbay.log interface. In our production environment,
we pass the JVM arguments (via JAVA_OPTIONS in /etc/default/jetty6):
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=/usr/share/jetty6/etc/logging.properties
-Dorg.mortbay.log.class=orc.SyslogishJettyLogger
The logging.properties file referenced above sets up a ConsoleHandler
with our custom SyslogishFormatter, rather than Java's SimpleFormatter.
Note that these custom classes must be on the classpath before the
java.util.logging.LogManager.class and org.mortbay.log.Log classes are
initialized.  Fortunately, the Jetty start.jar code does not reference
either of these classes, so you can use the standard Jetty classloading
features, shuch as putting classfiles or JARs under jetty.home/lib/ext.
