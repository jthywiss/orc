Write a function which, given a channel, publishes
every value received over the channel, omitting
repeated values (so each value published is unique).
Hint: use a Set to record the values seen in the
channel.

      Orc Set proxy is not really generic;
      the contains method takes an Object argument.
      So we can't check the call seen.contains
      without the bound X <: Object, but the
      typechecker does not currently implement
      bounded polymorphism, so we tell it not
      to check the method call.
