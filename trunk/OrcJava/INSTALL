OVERVIEW
--------

In this package you should find:

- orc-X.Y.Z.jar: the main Orc JAR file.
- examples/: example programs written in Orc.
- doc/: documentation of the Orc language and libraries.

Read one of the following sections depending on your OS.

GENERAL USERS
-------------

You can run Orc programs directly from any OS's command prompt.

To run <your script file>:
  java -cp orc-X.Y.Z.jar orc.Orc <your script file>

To see command-line arguments, run:
  java -cp orc-X.Y.Z.jar orc.Orc -help

WINDOWS USERS
-------------

Orc comes with a GUI tool for running scripts.

To start the GUI, double-click on the JAR file's icon, or run:
  java -cp orc-X.Y.Z.jar orc.gui.OrcGui

To see command-line arguments for the GUI, run:
  java -cp orc-X.Y.Z.jar orc.gui.OrcGui -help

To associate .orc files with the Orc GUI tool, run SETUP.BAT from the directory
where you put orc-X.Y.Z.jar.  If you move the orc-X.Y.Z.jar, you will need to
rerun SETUP.BAT.  If desired, you can edit the association in Explorer's "File
Types" dialog to add command-line arguments or change the icon.

APPLE OS X USERS
----------------

You should download the Orc app for OS X.  To run an Orc script, double-click it
or drag it onto the Orc app.

DEVELOPERS

Orc sites.  Simply place orc-X.Y.Z.jar on your project's classpath.
