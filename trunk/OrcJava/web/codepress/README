This is Codepress 0.9.6, downloaded from http://codepress.org/

We have made the following changes to integrate with Orc:
- Fixed auto-complete to work with HTML special characters (">", "<", and "&")
- Added orc syntax highlighting
- Added auto-indent
- <br> is removed during syntax highlighting to make multi-line stuff easier
