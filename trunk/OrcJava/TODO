- allow web services to provide constructors for complex objects
- add executor oil validation to only allow "safe" sites
- recover from timeout in client "listen" calls (if necessary)

- web UI: slows down when editing very large programs
- syntax for curried defs (def x(a)(b)(c) = ... <=> val x = lambda (a) = lambda (b) = lambda (c) = ...)
- fix JSON binding to convert directly from Java to JSON types
- fix JSON binding to work with endpointInterface
