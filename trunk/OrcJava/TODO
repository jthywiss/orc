- rewrite web services to generate classes dynamically for use in servlet scripts
- add executor oil validation to only allow "safe" sites
- recover from timeout in client "listen" calls (if necessary)
- web UI: freezes when running examples/time/detector.orc (presumably due to too many publications); should we throttle them?
- web UI: slows down when editing very large programs
- web UI: weird problems with inserting newlines before existing lines
- syntax for curried defs (def x(a)(b)(c) = ... <=> val x = lambda (a) = lambda (b) = lambda (c) = ...)
- standard cond, if, and case syntax
- exception handling
- finalizers for terminated tokens (may be incorporated into exception handling)
