/**
 * Interface for writing traces from a single Orc thread. Methods correspond to
 * events which may be traced; in essence this is like a visitor of execution
 * events. Some guidelines used to organize events:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Steps shared by several logical events are made explicit. So for example
 * when a thread encounters an error, this results in
 * {@link #error(TokenException)} followed by {@link #die()}. We could make the
 * {@link #die()} implicit but making it explicit facilitates code reuse in the
 * client and simplifies queries.
 * <li>When two threads interact, at least two events are involved: one for the
 * cause and one for the effect. This ensures that we can reconstruct the
 * behavior of a thread looking only at events in that thread. The effect event
 * includes a pointer back to the cause event.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * "Trace" objects ({@link StoreTrace} et al) serve as abstract handles for
 * events and are used to record relationships between events in different
 * threads. Since Java doesn't have existential types, implementors have to cast
 * these objects to the appropriate concrete types internally. This is safe as
 * long as all the TokenTracers produced by a single {@link Tracer} use use
 * compatible concrete trace types.
