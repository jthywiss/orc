/**
 * Generate and query Orc trace files. An Orc trace file is a gziped sequence

 * These trace files are written with {@link OutputStreamTracer} and read
 * with {@link orc.trace.query.InputStreamEventCursor}. It's possible to define
 * other kinds of tracers and trace formats by providing your own implementation
 * of {@link TokenTracer}.
