Binary/Unary operator syntax

Interface to web services
	Plan to use Apache Axis2 to support asynchronous calls

Misc sites
	Clock
	Persistent storage
	Access to files

	William: Here are my notes on things to add to the implementation.

* User guide: how to set up and run. Which sites can be called
  directly. What needs to be done to send mail from other locations.

* Implementation guide: Overall system description. Documentations of
  individual modules.

* Allow execution of a file. The file contains a set of definitions
  and one goal expression.

* Allow "import" of a file into another file, i.e., textual inclusion.

* Allow commenting large regions using, say, {- -}

* Implement cell, word and channel as sites. This will permit reading
  from keyboard and writing to display.

* Receive response from sites.

* Allow infix arithmetic and logical expressions as arguments of site
  calls. I want to limit the expressions to side-effect free,
  deterministic, immediate site calls. An easy solution is to convert
  the expression to prefix form since you already support it.

*  Design a Web site where students can input a file and run it.
