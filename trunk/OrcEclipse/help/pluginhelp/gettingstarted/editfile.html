		<h1>Edit an Orc File</h1>
		<p>
			In this section, you will try out some of the editing assistance the Orc plug-in provides for Orc source code. 
		</p>
		<h2>Editing a File</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>If needed, in the Project Explorer, expand the project and folders containing the Orc file of interest.</li>
			<li>Double-click the Orc file you wish to view and edit, or try this simple program:<code><pre>
-- Testing the Orc editor

def SimpleDef() = "SimpleDef"

def WithParmsDef(x, y, z) = (x | y | z)

def OuterDef() =
    def InnerDef() = "InnerDef"
    "OuterDef"

site TestSite = orc.runtime.sites.core.Let

class TestClass = java.lang.String

val testval = "testval"

type Type1 = Bot


(1 | 2 | 3) >x> x+40
			</pre></code>You can copy the above text and paste it into the editor.  Save the file.</li>
			<li>Notice the syntax highlighting. Different kinds of elements in the Orc source code are rendered in unique colors.</li>
			<li>Look at the Outline view. It displays an outline of the Orc file including the include declarations, definitions, site
			declarations, class declarations, type declarations and val declarations. The Outline view uses icons to annotate Orc elements.</li>
			<li>Type a syntactically invalid character sequence, like <strong><kbd>- - -</kbd></strong> (with spaces). Note the "red X in a circle"
			problem marker in the ruler on the left of your text, and the red underlining under the text. Delete the syntactically invalid
			character sequence.</li>
			<li>Type a character that does not belong in Orc source code, like <strong><kbd>$</kbd></strong>. Note the inverse red
			highlighting. This is useful, for example, when cut-and-pasting code from formatted documents, where odd characters such
			as non-breaking spaces or "curly quotes" can accidentally end up in your code. Delete the character that does not belong
			in Orc source code.</li>
			<li>In the Outline view, try pressing the <strong>Sort by Name</strong> button (it looks like a downward-pointing arrow with "a"
			and "z" next to it).  Notice that the outline items are now sorted alphabetically within categories. Click on an entry in the
			outline.  Note that this selects this declaration in the source code.  This is a quick way to navigate declarations in large files.
			Press the <strong>Sort by Name</strong> button again to return to textual order.</li>

			<li>Have you ever counted parentheses, trying to math open and close pairs? Type <strong><kbd>(1 | (2 | (3 | (4))))<kbd></stong>
			and move the cursor to the right one of the close parentheses.  Note the box around the matching open parentheses.</li>
