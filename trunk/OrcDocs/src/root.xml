<para>
Orc is a programming language designed to make distributed and
concurrent programs simple and intuitive to write. Orc expresses
orchestration, a type of structured concurrency. It emphasizes the
flow of control and gives a global view of a concurrent system. Orc
is well-suited for task orchestration, a form of
concurrent programming with applications in workflow, business process
management, and web service orchestration. Orc provides constructs to
orchestrate the concurrent invocation of services while managing
time-outs, priorities, and failures of services or communication.  To
learn more about Orc and run your own Orc programs, visit the website:

<chapter id="chapter.language"><title>The Orc Programming Language</title>

<section><title>Introduction</title>


<para>
This chapter describes the Orc programming language in three steps. In Section 1.2, we
discuss a small subset of Orc called Cor. Cor is a pure functional language,
which has no features for concurrency, has no state, and does not communicate 
with external services. Cor introduces us to the parts of Orc that are most familiar 
from existing programming languages, such as arithmetic operations, variables,
conditionals, and functions.
</para>

<para>
In Section 1.3, we consider Orc itself, which in addition to Cor, comprises 
external services and combinators for concurrent orchestration of those services. 
We show how Orc interacts with these external services, how the combinators can be
used to build up complex orchestrations from simple base expressions, and how the 
functional constructs of Cor take on new, subtler behaviors in the concurrent 
context of Orc.
</para>

<para>
In Section 1.4, we discuss some additional features of Orc that extend 
the basic syntax. These are useful for creating large-scale Orc programs, but 
they are not essential to the understanding of the language.
</para>
 
</section> 


<section><title>Cor: A Functional Subset</title>



 
<para>
In this section we introduce Cor, a pure functional subset of the Orc language.
Users of functional programming languages such as Haskell and ML will already be 
familiar with many of the key concepts of Cor.  
</para>

<para>
A Cor program is an <firstterm>expression</firstterm>. Cor expressions are built
up recursively from smaller expressions. Cor <firstterm>evaluates</firstterm> an expression
to reduce it to some simple <firstterm>value</firstterm> which cannot be evaluated further, 
for example a list of numbers or a Boolean truth value. This value is called the <firstterm>
result</firstterm> of the expression.
</para>

<para>
In the following subsections we introduce the concepts of Cor. First, we talk about
simple constants, such as numbers and truth values, and the operations that we can perform
on those values. Then we introduce conditionals (<code>if then else</code>). Then we 
introduce variables and binding, as a way to give a name to the value of an expression. 
After that, we talk about constructing data structures, and examining those structures
using patterns. Lastly, we introduce functions.
</para> 

<para>
Table 1.1 describes the syntax of Cor. Each part of the syntax is explained 
in a subsequent section.

<para>
Where relevant, syntactic constructs are ordered by precedence, from highest to lowest. For example, among expressions, calls have higher precedence than
operators, which in turn have higher precedence than conditionals.
</para>


<section id="cor.constants"><title>Constants</title>
<para>
The simplest expression one can write is a constant. It evaluates trivially
to that constant value. 
</para>

<para>

Cor has three types of constants, and thus for the moment three types of values:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
Boolean: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>
</listitem>

<listitem>
Number: <code> 5, -1, 2.71828, ... </code>
</listitem> 

<listitem>
String: <code>"orc"</code>, <code>"ceci n'est pas une |"</code>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

</section>

<section id="language.base.operators"><title>Operators</title>
<para>
Cor has a standard set of arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators.
As in most other programming languages, they are written in the usual 
infix style. They have Java-like operator precedence, which can be
overridden by adding parentheses.  
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist><title>Examples</title>
<listitem><code>1+2</code> evaluates to <code>3</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>(98+2)*17</code> evaluates to <code>1700</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>4 = 20 / 5</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>3-5 >= 5-3 </code> evaluates to <code>false</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code><![CDATA[true && (false || true)]]></code> evaluates to <code>true</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>"leap" + "frog"</code> evaluates to <code>"leapfrog"</code>.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</tgroup>
</table>

</para>

<para>
There is also a unary negation operator, written <code>-</code>, for example <code>-(2 ** 5)</code>.
</para>

<para>
The <code>=</code> operator can compare values of any type. Values of different type are always unequal; for example,
<code>10 = true</code> evaluates to <code>false</code>.
</para>

<section><title>Silent Expression</title>
<para>
There are situations where an expression evaluation is stuck, because it is attempting to perform 
some impossible operation and cannot compute a value. In that case, the expression is <firstterm>silent</firstterm>. 
An expression is also silent if it depends on the result of a silent subexpression. For example, the following
expressions are silent: <code>10/0</code>, <code>6 + false</code>, <code>3 + 1/0</code>, <code>4 + true = 5</code>.
</para>

<para>
Cor is a dynamically typed language. A Cor implementation does not statically
check the type correctness of an expression; instead, an expression with a type
error is simply silent when it is evaluated.
</para>

<warning>
Silent expressions can produce side effects.  For example, on encountering a
type error, Orc will print an error message to the console.  However the
expression containing the type error will not publish a value, and in this
respect it is silent.
</warning>

</section>

</section>


<section><title>Conditionals</title>

<para>
A conditional expression in Cor is of the form 
<code>if</code> E <code>then</code> F <code>else</code> G. 
Its meaning is similar to that in other languages: the value
of the expression is the value of F if and only if E evaluates to true, 
or the value of G if and only if E evaluates to false. Note that G is not
evaluated at all if E evaluates to true, and similarly F is not evaluated
at all if E evaluates to false. Thus, for example, evaluation of 
<code>if true then 2+3 else 1/0</code> does not evaluate <code>1/0</code>;
it only evaluates <code>2+3</code>.
</para>

<para>
Unlike other languages, expressions in Cor may be silent. If E is
silent, then the entire expression is silent. And if E evaluates to true 
but F is silent (or if E evaluates to false and G is silent) then the 
expression is silent.
</para>

<para>
Note that conditionals have lower precedence than any of the operators.
For example, <code>if false then 1 else 2 + 3</code> is equivalent to
<code>if false then 1 else (2 + 3)</code>, not <code>(if false then 1 else 2) + 3</code>.
</para>

<para>
The behavior of conditionals is summarized by the following table
(<emphasis>v</emphasis> denotes a value).

</section>


<section id="cor.variables"><title>Variables</title>

<para>
A <firstterm>variable</firstterm> can be bound to a value. A <firstterm>declaration</firstterm> binds one or
more variables to values. The simplest form of declaration is <code>val</code>, which 
evaluates an expression and binds its result to a variable. Declarations follow the rules of 
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_scope">lexical scoping</link>.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
val x = 1 + 2
val y = x + x
]]></programlisting>

These declarations bind variable <code>x</code> to 3 and variable <code>y</code> to 6.
</para>


<para>
If the expression on the right side of a <code>val</code> is silent, then the variable is not bound, but 
evaluation of other declarations and expressions continues. If an evaluated expression depends on that
variable, that expression is silent.

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
val x = 1/0
val y = 4+5
if false then x else y]]></programlisting>

Evaluation of the declaration <code>val y = 4+5</code> and the expression <code>if false then x else y</code>
may continue even though <code>x</code> is not bound. The expression evaluates to 9.

</para>

<!-- 
<note>
<code>val</code> expresses a limited form of concurrency called <emphasis>declarative concurrency</emphasis> (add
biblio reference to CTMCP). A declaration may be evaluated in parallel with the declarations and expressions that
follow it; any expression which uses a variable introduced by a declaration that is still evaluating will wait for
that evaluation to complete. However, since Cor is a purely declarative language, and cannot express state changes
or the progress of time, it is impossible to distinguish a parallel evaluation from a sequential evaluation within
Cor.
</note>
 -->

</section>


<section id="cor.data"><title>Data Structures</title>

<para>
Cor supports two basic data structures, <firstterm>tuples</firstterm> and <firstterm>lists</firstterm>.
</para>

<section><title>Tuples</title>
<para>
A <firstterm>tuple expression</firstterm> is a comma-separated sequence of at least two 
expressions, enclosed by parentheses. Each expression is evaluated; the value of the whole 
tuple expression is a tuple containing each of these values in order. 
If any of the expressions is silent, then the whole tuple expression is silent.
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist><title>Examples</title>
<listitem><code>(1+2, 7)</code> evaluates to <code>(3,7)</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code><![CDATA[ ("true" + "false", true || false, true && false) ]]></code> evaluates to <code>("truefalse", true, false)</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>(2/2, 2/1, 2/0)</code> is silent.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Lists</title>

<para>
A <firstterm>list expression</firstterm> is a comma-separated sequence of expressions enclosed by
square brackets. It may be of any length, including zero. Each expression is evaluated; the value 
of the whole list expression is a list containing each of these values in order.   
If any of the expressions is silent, then the whole list expression is silent.
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist><title>Examples</title>
<listitem><code>[1,2+3] </code> evaluates to <code>[1,5]</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code><![CDATA[ [true && true] ]]> </code> evaluates to <code>[true]</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>[]</code> evaluates vacuously to <code>[]</code>, the empty list.</listitem>
<listitem><code>[5, 5 + true, 5]</code> is silent.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
There is also a concatenation (<firstterm>cons</firstterm>) operation on lists,
written F<code>:</code>G, where F and G are expressions. Its result is a new list whose first element is the 
value of F and whose remaining elements are the list value of G. The <code>:</code> operator is right associative,
so F<code>:</code>G<code>:</code>H is F<code>:(</code>G<code>:</code>H<code>)</code>.
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist><title>Examples</title>
<listitem><code>(1+3):[2+5,6]</code> evaluates to <code>[4,7,6]</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>2:2:5:[] </code> evaluates to <code>[2,2,5]</code>.</listitem>
<listitem>Suppose <code>t</code> is bound to [3,5]. Then <code>1:t</code> evaluates to <code>[1,3,5]</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>2:3</code> is silent, because <code>3</code> is not a list.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

</section>

</section>

<section><title>Patterns</title>

<para>
We have seen how to construct data structures. But how do we examine them, and use them? We use <firstterm>patterns</firstterm>.
</para>

<para>
A pattern is a powerful way to bind variables. When writing <code>val</code> declarations, instead of just
binding one variable, we can replace the variable name with a more complex pattern that follows the structure of the
value, and matches its components. A pattern's structure is called its <firstterm>shape</firstterm>; a
pattern may take the shape of any structured value. A pattern can hierarchically match a value, going deep into its 
structure. It can also bind an entire structure to a variable.

</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist><title>Examples</title>
<listitem><code>val (x,y) = (2+3,2*3)</code> binds <code>x</code> to 5 and <code>y</code> to 6.</listitem>
<listitem>
<code>val [a,b,c] = ["one", "two", "three"]</code> binds <code>a</code> to "one", 
<code>b</code> to "two", and <code>c</code> to "three".
</listitem>
<listitem>
<code>val ((a,b),c) = ((1, true), (2, false))</code> binds <code>a</code> to 1, <code>b</code> to <code>true</code>,
and <code>c</code> to <code>(2,false)</code>.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Patterns are <firstterm>linear</firstterm>; that is, a pattern may mention a variable name at most once. 
For example, <code>(x,y,x)</code> is not a valid pattern.
</para>

<para>
Note that a pattern may fail to match a value, if it does not have the same shape as that value. In a <code>val</code>
declaration, this has the same effect as evaluating a silent expression. No variable in the pattern is bound, and
if any one of those variables is later evaluated, it is silent.
</para>

<para>
It is often useful to ignore parts of the value that are not relevant. We can use the
wildcard pattern, written <code>_</code>, to do this; it matches any shape and binds no
variables.
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist><title>Examples</title>
<listitem><code>val (x,_,_) = (1,(2,2),[3,3,3])</code> binds <code>x</code> to 1.</listitem>
<listitem><code>val [[_,x],[_,y]] = [[1,3],[2,4]]</code> binds <code>x</code> to 3 and <code>y</code> to 4.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

</section>

<section id="cor.functions"><title>Functions</title>

<para>
Like most other programming languages, Cor provides the capability to define <firstterm>functions</firstterm>,
which are expressions that have a defined name, and have some number of parameters. Functions are declared 
using the keyword <code>def</code>, in the following way.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Add(x,y) = x+y
]]></programlisting>

The expression on the right of the <code>=</code> is called the <firstterm>body</firstterm> of the function.
</para>

<para>
After defining the function, we can <firstterm>call</firstterm> it. A call looks just like the left side of
the declaration except that the variable names (the <firstterm>formal parameters</firstterm>) have been 
replaced by expressions (the <firstterm>actual parameters</firstterm>). 
</para>

<para>
To evaluate a call, we treat it as a sequence of <code>val</code> declarations associating the formal
parameters with the actual parameters, followed by the body of the function. 

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- Evaluation of Add(1+2,3+4) -}
val x = 1+2
val y = 3+4
x+y
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist><title>Examples</title>
<listitem><code>Add(10,10*10)</code> evaluates to <code>110</code>.</listitem>
<listitem><code>Add(Add(5,3),5)</code> evaluates to <code>13</code>.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Notice that the evaluation strategy of functions allows a call to proceed even if some of the actual
parameters are silent, so long as the values of those actual parameters are not used in the evaluation
of the body.

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def cond(b,x,y) = if b then x else y
cond(true, 3, 5/0)
]]></programlisting>

This evaluates to <code>3</code> even though <code>5/0</code> is silent, because <code>y</code> is not
needed.

</para>


<para>
A function definition or call may have zero arguments, in which case we write <code>()</code> for the arguments.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Zero() = 0
]]></programlisting>
</para>


<section><title>Recursion</title>

<para>
Functions can be recursive; that is, the name of a function may be used in its own body.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Sumto(n) = if n < 1 then 0 else n + Sumto(n-1)
]]></programlisting>

Then, <code>Sumto(5)</code> evaluates to 15.
</para>  

<para>
Mutual recursion is also supported.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Even(n) = 
  if (n > 0) then Odd(n-1)
  else if (n < 0) then Odd(n+1)
  else true
def Odd(n) = 
  if (n > 0) then Even(n-1)
  else if (n < 0) then Even(n+1)
  else false
]]></programlisting>

There is no special keyword for mutual recursion; any contiguous sequence of function declarations is assumed to be 
mutually recursive.
</para>

</section>

<section id="cor.closures"><title>Closures</title>

<para>
Functions are actually values, just like any other value. Defining a function creates a special value called a 
<firstterm>closure</firstterm>; the name of the function is a variable and its bound value is the closure. Thus, 
a closure can be put into a data structure, or bound to some other variable, just like any other value.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def a(x) = x-3
def b(y) = y*4
val funs = (a,b)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Like any other value, a closure can be passed as an argument to another function. This means that Cor
supports <emphasis>higher-order</emphasis> functions.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Onetwosum(f) = f(1) + f(2)
def Triple(x) = x * 3
]]></programlisting>

Then, <code>Onetwosum(Triple)</code> is <code>Triple(1) + Triple(2)</code>, which is <code>1 * 3 + 2 * 3</code> which evaluates to <code>9</code>.

</para>

<para>
Since all declarations (including function declarations) in Cor are lexically scoped, these closures are
<emphasis>lexical closures</emphasis>. This means that when a closure is created, if the body of the
function contains any variables other than the formal parameters, the bindings for those variables are
stored in the closure. Then, when the closure is called, the evaluation of the function body uses those 
stored variable bindings.  
</para>


</section>

<section><title>Lambda</title>

<para>
Sometimes one would like to create a closure directly, without bothering to give it a name. 
There is a special keyword <code>lambda</code> for this purpose. By writing a function
definition without the keyword <code>def</code> and replacing the function name with
the keyword <code>lambda</code>, that definition becomes an expression which evaluates to a closure. 

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def Onetwosum(f) = f(1) + f(2)

Onetwosum( lambda(x) = x * 3 )
{- 
  identical to:
  def triple(x) = x * 3
  onetwosum(triple)
-}]]></programlisting>

Then, <code>Onetwosum( lambda(x) = x * 3 )</code> evaluates to 9. 

</para>

<para>
Since a function defined using <code>lambda</code> has no name, it is not possible to define 
a recursive function in this way. Only <code>def</code> can create a recursive function.
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Clauses</title>

<para>
The combination of functions and pattern matching offers a powerful capability: 
<firstterm>clausal</firstterm> definition of functions. We can define expressions which execute 
different code depending on the structure of their arguments. 
</para>


<para>
Here's an example.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Sum([]) = 0
def Sum(h:t) = h + Sum(t)
]]></programlisting>

<code>Sum(L)</code> publishes the sum of the numbers in the list <code>L</code>. It has two clauses: 
one which matches the empty list, and one which matches any nonempty list. If its argument is an empty 
list, it returns 0, the appropriate sum for an empty list. If the argument is a nonempty list, it adds 
the first element of that list to the sum of all of the other elements. In this way, it recursively finds 
the sum of the list.
</para>

<para>
A function may have multiple clauses, each of which has a sequence of patterns to match each argument, 
and a body expression. Naturally, all clauses of a function must have the same number of arguments. Any 
contiguous sequence of definitions with the same name and different arguments is interpreted as a clausal 
definition, where each individual declaration is a clause of the larger function. 
</para>

<para>
When the function is called, the clauses are tried in the order in which they appear until a match is found. 
If no clause matches, the call remains silent.
</para>

<para>
We allow a new form of pattern which is very useful in clausal definition of functions: a constant pattern.
A constant pattern is a match only for the same constant value. We can use this to define the "base case"
of a recursive function in a straightforward way.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- Fibonacci numbers -}
def Fib(0) = 1
def Fib(1) = 1
def Fib(n) = if (n < 0) then 0 else Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
]]></programlisting>

This definition of the Fibonacci function is straightforward, but slow, due to the repeated work in recursive
calls to <code>Fib</code>. We can define a linear-time version, again with the help of pattern matching:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- Alternate definition of the Fibonacci function -}

{- A helper function: find the pair (Fibonacci(n-1), Fibonacci(n)) -}
def H(0) = (1,1)
def H(n) = 
  val (x,y) = H(n-1)
  (y,x+y)

def Fib(n) = 
  if (n < 0) then 
    0 
  else 
    val (x,_) = H(n) 
    x
    
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
As a more complex example of matching, consider the following function which takes
a list argument and returns a new list containing only the first <code>n</code> 
elements of the argument list. 

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Take(0,_) = []
def Take(n,h:t) = if (n > 0) then h:(Take(n-1,t)) else []
]]></programlisting>
</para>


<para>
Mutual recursion and clausal definitions are allowed to occur together.
For example, this function takes a list and computes a new list in which every other element is repeated:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Stutter([]) = []
def Stutter(h:t) = h:h:Mutter(t)
def Mutter([]) = []
def Mutter(h:t) = h:Stutter(t)
]]></programlisting>

<code>Stutter([1,2,3])</code> evaluates to <code>[1,1,2,3,3]</code>.
</para>

<para>
Clauses of mutually recursive functions may also be interleaved, to make
them easier to read.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def Even(0) = true
def Odd(0) = false
def Even(n) = Odd(if n > 0 then n-1 else n+1)
def Odd(n) = Even(if n > 0 then n-1 else n+1)
]]></programlisting>

</para>

</section>

</section>

<section><title>Comments</title>
<para>
Cor has two kinds of comments.   

</para>

<para>
A line which begins with two dashes (<code>--</code>), preceded only by whitespace, is a single line comment.
The region from the two dashes to the next encountered newline, inclusive, is ignored.  
<programlisting><![CDATA[
-- This is a single line comment.
	 -- This is also a single line comment.
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Multi-line comments are enclosed by matching braces of the form <code><![CDATA[{- -}]]></code>. 
Multi-line comments may be nested. They may appear anywhere, even in the middle of an expression.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- 
   This is a
   multiline comment.
-}
   
{- Multiline comments {- can be nested -} -}

{- They may appear anywhere, -} 
1 + {- even in the middle of an expression. -} 2 + 3
]]></programlisting>

</para>

</section>

</section>



<section><title>Orc: Orchestrating services</title>

<para>
Cor is a pure declarative language. It has no state, since variables are bound at most once 
and cannot be reassigned. Evaluation of an expression results in at most one value.
It cannot communicate with the outside world except by producing a value. The full 
Orc language transcends these limitations by incorporating the orchestration of external services.
We introduce the term <firstterm>site</firstterm> to denote an external service which can be
called from an Orc program.
</para>

<para>
As in Cor, an Orc program is an  <firstterm>expression</firstterm>; Orc expressions are built 
up recursively from smaller expressions. Orc is a superset of Cor, i.e., all Cor expressions are 
also Orc expressions. Orc expressions are <firstterm>executed</firstterm>, rather than evaluated; 
an execution may call external services and <firstterm>publish</firstterm> some number of 
values (possibly zero). Different executions of the same expression may have completely different
behaviors; they may call different services, may receive different responses from the same site,
and may publish different values. Expressions in the functional subset, though, will display
the same behavior in all executions.
</para>

<para>
In the following sections we discuss the features of Orc. First, we discuss how Orc
communicates with external services. Then we introduce Orc's concurrency <firstterm>combinators</firstterm>,
which combine expressions into larger orchestrations and manage concurrent executions. 
We have already discussed the functional subset of Orc in our coverage of Cor, but we
reprise some of those topics; some Cor constructs exhibit new behaviors in the 
concurrent, stateful context of Orc.
</para>

<para>
The following figure summarizes the syntax of Orc as an extension of the syntax of Cor. 
The original Cor grammar rules are abbreviated by ellipses (...).

<section><title>Communicating with external services</title>

<para>
An Orc expression may be a site call. Sites are called using the same syntax as a 
function call, but with a slightly different meaning. Sites are introduced and bound 
to variables by a special declaration.  
</para>

<section><title>Calling a site</title>

<para>
Suppose that the variable <code>Google</code> is bound to a site which invokes the
Google search engine service in "I'm Feeling Lucky" mode. A call to <code>Google</code> 
looks just like a function call. Calling <code>Google</code> requests the URL of the top 
result for the given search term.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- Get the top search result for "computation orchestration" -}
Google("computation orchestration")
]]></programlisting>

Once the Google search service determines the top result, it sends a response. The site 
call then publishes that response. Note that the service might not respond: Google's 
servers might be down, the network might be down, or the search might yield no result URL.  
</para>

<para>
A site call sends only a single request to an external service and receives at most one
response. These restrictions have two important consequences. First, all of the information needed 
for the call must be present before contacting the service. Thus, site calls are strict; all 
arguments must be bound before the call can proceed. If any argument is silent, the call never occurs.
Second, a site call publishes at most one value, since at most one response is received.
</para>

<para>
A call to a site has exactly one of the following effects: 

<orderedlist>
<listitem>The site returns a value, called its <firstterm>response</firstterm>.</listitem>
<listitem>The site communicates that it will never respond to the call; we say that the call has <firstterm>halted</firstterm></listitem>
<listitem>The site neither returns a value nor indicates that the call has halted; we say that the call is <firstterm>pending</firstterm>.</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
In the last two cases, the site call is said to be silent. However, unlike a silent expression in Cor, 
a silent site call in Orc might perform some meaningful computation or communication; silence does 
not necessarily indicate an error. Since halted site calls and pending site calls are both silent,
they cannot usually be distinguished from each other; only the <link linkend="combinator.otherwise">
otherwise combinator</link> can tell the difference. 
</para>


<para>
A site is a value, just like an integer or a list. It may be bound to a variable, passed 
as an argument, or published by an execution, just like any other value.
</para> 

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{-
  Create a search site from a search engine URL,
  bind the variable Search to that site,
  then use that site to search for a term.
-}
val Search = SearchEngine("http://www.google.com/")
Search("first class value")
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
A site is sometimes called only for its effect on the external world; its return
value is irrelevant. Many sites which do not need to return a meaningful value will
instead return a <firstterm>signal</firstterm>: a special value which carries no 
information (analogous to the unit value <code>()</code> in ML). The signal value
can be written as <code>signal</code> within Orc programs.


<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
{- 
  Use the 'println' site to print a string, followed by
  a newline, to an output console.
  The return value of this site call is a signal.
-}
println("Hello, World!")
]]></programlisting>
</para>


</section>


<section id="orc-declaring-a-site"><title>Declaring a site</title>

<para>
A <code>site</code> declaration makes some service available as a site and
binds it to a variable. The service might be an object in the host language 
(e.g. a class instance in Java), or an external service on the web which is accessed 
through some protocol like SOAP or REST, or even a primitive operation like addition. 


<!-- (add this section back in when the services chapter is ready to go)
We will discuss the particulars of these declarations, and the guidelines for accessing 
web-based services or creating one's own services, in <link linkend="chapter.services">Chapter 3</link>.
Also, -->
Many useful sites are already defined in the Orc standard library, documented
in <link linkend="appendix.library">Appendix B</link>. For now, we present a simple 
type of site declaration: using an object in the host language as a site.  
</para>

<para>
The following example instantiates a Java object to be used as a site in an Orc program, specifically
a Java object which provides an asynchronous buffer service. The declaration uses a
fully qualified Java class name to find and load a class, and creates an instance of that
class to provide the service. 

<programlisting><![CDATA[
{-  Define the Buffer site  -}
site Buffer = orc.lib.state.Buffer
]]></programlisting>  
</para>

<section><title>The concurrency combinators of Orc</title>

<para>
Orc has four <firstterm>combinators</firstterm>: parallel, sequential, pruning, and otherwise. 
A combinator forms an expression from two component expressions. Each combinator captures a 
different aspect of concurrency. Syntactically, the combinators are written infix, and have
lower precedence than operators, but higher precedence than conditionals or declarations.
</para>

<section><title>The parallel combinator</title>

<para>
Orc's simplest combinator is <code>|</code>, the parallel combinator. Orc executes
the expression F <code>|</code> G, where F and G are Orc expressions, by executing 
F and G concurrently. Whenever F or G communicates with a service or publishes a value, 
F <code>|</code> G does so as well. 
</para>   


<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Publish 1 and 2 in parallel  
1 | 1+1
]]></programlisting>
</para>  

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- 
  Access two search sites, Google and Yahoo, in parallel.

  Publish any results they return.
  
  Since each call may publish a value, the expression
  may publish up to two values.
-}  
Google("cupcake") | Yahoo("cupcake")
]]></programlisting>
</para>  

<para>
The parallel combinator is fully associative: (F <code>|</code> G) <code>|</code> H and
F <code>|</code> (G <code>|</code> H) and F <code>|</code> G <code>|</code> H are all
equivalent.
</para> 

<para>
It is also commutative: F <code>|</code> G is equivalent to G <code>|</code> F.  
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Publish 1, 2, and 3 in parallel  
1+0 | 1+1 | 1+2
]]></programlisting>
</para>  


</section>

<section><title>The sequential combinator</title>

<para>
Now that we have expressions which publish multiple values, what can we do with those
publications? The sequential combinator, written F<code><![CDATA[ >x> ]]></code>G, 
combines the expression F, which may publish some values, with another expression G, 
which will use the values as they are published; <code>x</code> transmits the values
from F to G.
</para>

<para>
The execution of F<code><![CDATA[ >x> ]]></code>G starts by executing F. Whenever F publishes a value, 
a new copy of G is executed in parallel with F (and with any previous copies of G); in that
copy of G, variable <code>x</code> is bound to the value published by F. Values published by copies
of G are published by the whole expression, but the values published by F are not published
by the whole expression; they are consumed by the variable binding.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[

]]></programlisting>
</para>  




<para>
The sequential combinator may be written as F<code><![CDATA[ >]]></code>P<code><![CDATA[> ]]></code>G, 
where P is a pattern instead of just a variable name. Any value published by F is matched against the 
pattern P. If this match is successful, a new copy of G is started with all of the bindings from the match. 
Otherwise, the published value is simply ignored, and no new copy of G is executed.
</para>

<para>

</para>
 


<para>
We may also omit the variable entirely, writing <code><![CDATA[ >> ]]></code>. This
is equivalent to using a wildcard pattern: <code><![CDATA[ >_> ]]></code>
</para>

<para>
We may want to execute an expression just for its effects, and hide all of its publications.
We can do this using <code><![CDATA[ >> ]]></code> together with the special expression 
<code>stop</code>, which is always silent.  
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
{- 
  Print two strings to the console,
  but don't publish the return values of the calls.
-}
( println("goodbye") | println("world") ) >> stop
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The sequential combinator is right associative: F<code><![CDATA[ >x> ]]></code>G<code><![CDATA[ >y> ]]></code>H
is equivalent to F<code><![CDATA[ >x> (]]></code>G<code><![CDATA[ >y> ]]></code>H<code>)</code>. It has higher
precedence than the parallel combinator: F<code><![CDATA[ >x> ]]></code>G <code>|</code> H is equivalent to
<code>(</code>F<code><![CDATA[ >x> ]]></code>G <code>) |</code> H.
</para>

<para>
The right associativity of the sequential combinator makes it easy to bind variables in sequence and use
them together.
</para>

]]></programlisting>
</para>


</section>


<section><title>The pruning combinator</title>

<para>
The pruning combinator, written F<code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code>G, allows us to block 
a computation waiting for a result, or terminate a computation. The execution of 
F<code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code>G starts by executing F and G in parallel. Whenever
F publishes a value, that value is published by the entire execution. When G publishes
its first value, that value is bound to x in F, and then the execution of G is immediately 
<firstterm>terminated</firstterm>. A terminated expression cannot call any sites or 
publish any values.
</para>

<para>
During the execution of F, any part of the execution that depends on <code>x</code> 
will be suspended until <code>x</code> is bound (to the first value published by G). If G
never publishes a value, that part of the execution is suspended forever. 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Publish either 5 or 6, but not both
x+2 <x< (3 | 4)
]]></programlisting>
</para>  

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
-- Query Google and Yahoo for a search result
-- Print out the result that arrives first; ignore the other result
println(result) <result< ( Google("cupcake") | Yahoo("cupcake") )
]]></programlisting>
</para>  

<para>
Though a terminated execution may not make any new calls, the calls
that it has already made will continue normally; their responses are simply
ignored. This may have surprising consequences when a call has side effects,
as in the following example.

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
{- 
  This example actually prints both "true" and "false" to the
  console, regardless of which call responds first.
-}
stop <x< println("true") | println("false")
]]></programlisting>

Both of the <code>println</code> calls are initiated before either one of
them publishes a value and terminates the expression. Once the expression
is terminated, no new calls occur, but the other <code>println</code> call
still proceeds and still has the effect of printing its message to the
console.
</para>


<para>
The pruning combinator may include a full pattern P instead of just a variable name. Any
value published by G is matched against the pattern P. If this match is successful, then G
terminates and all of the bindings of the pattern P are made in F. Otherwise, the published 
value is simply ignored and G continues to execute.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Publish either 9 or 25, but not 16.
x*x <(x,true)< ( (3,true) | (4,false) | (5,true) )
]]></programlisting>
</para>  

<para>
Note that even if <code>(4,false)</code> is published before <code>(3,true)</code> or <code>(5,true)</code>, 
it is ignored. The right side continues to execute and will publish one of <code>(3,true)</code> or 
<code>(5,true)</code>.
</para>


<para>
The pruning combinator is left associative: F<code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code>G<code><![CDATA[ <y< ]]></code>H
is equivalent to <code>(</code>F<code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code>G<code><![CDATA[) <y< ]]></code>H. It has lower
precedence than the parallel combinator: F<code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code>G <code>|</code> H is equivalent to
F<code><![CDATA[ <x< (]]></code>G <code>|</code> H<code>)</code>.
</para>


</section>


<section id="combinator.otherwise"><title>The otherwise combinator</title>

<para>
Orc has a fourth concurrency combinator: the <firstterm>otherwise</firstterm> combinator,
written F<code> ; </code>G. The execution of F<code> ; </code> G proceeds as follows.
First, F is executed. If F <firstterm>completes</firstterm>, and has not published any values, 
then G executes. If F did publish one or more values, then G is ignored. The publications of 
F <code>;</code> G are those of F if F publishes, or those of G otherwise.
</para>

<para>
We determine when an expression completes using the following rules.

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>A Cor expression completes when it is fully evaluated; if it is silent, it completes immediately.</listitem>

<para>
The otherwise combinator is fully associative, so F <code>;</code> G <code>;</code> H and
(F <code>;</code> G) <code>;</code> H and F <code>;</code> (G <code>;</code> H) are
all equivalent. It has lower precedence than the other three combinators. 
</para>

<para>
The otherwise combinator was not present in the original formulation of the Orc concurrency 
calculus; it has been added to support computation and iteration over strictly finite data. 
Sequential programs conflate the concept of producing a value with the concept of completion. 
Orc separates these two concepts; variable binding combinators like <code><![CDATA[ >x> ]]></code> 
and <code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code> handle values, whereas <code>;</code> detects the completion 
of an execution.
</para>

<section><title>Revisiting Cor expressions</title>

<para>
Some Cor expressions have new behaviors in the context of Orc, due to the introduction
of concurrency and of sites.
</para>

<section><title>Operators</title>

<para>
The arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators are actually calls to sites, simply
written in infix style with the expected operator symbols. For example, <code>2+3</code>
is actually <code>(+)(2,3)</code>, where <code>(+)</code> is a primitive site provided
by the language itself. All of the operators can be used directly as sites in this way;
the name of the site is the operator enclosed by parentheses, e.g. <code>(**)</code>,
<code>(>=)</code>, etc. Negation (unary minus) is named <code>(0-)</code>.
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Conditionals</title>

<para>
The conditional expression <code>if</code> E <code>then</code> F <code>else</code> G
is actually a derived form based on a site named <code>if</code>. The <code>if</code>
site takes a boolean argument; it returns a signal if that argument is <code>true</code>,
or remains silent if the argument is <code>false</code>.
</para>

<para>
<code>if</code> E <code>then</code> F <code>else</code> G is equivalent 
to <code>(<![CDATA[ if(b) >> ]]></code>F<code><![CDATA[ | if(~b) >> ]]></code>G<code>)<![CDATA[ <b< ]]></code>E.
</para>

<para>
 When the <code>else</code> branch of a conditional is unneeded, we can write <code>if</code> F <code>then</code> G,
 with no <code>else</code> branch. This is equivalent to <code>if(</code>E<code>) >> </code>F.
</para>

</section>


<section><title><code>val</code></title>

<para>
The declaration <code>val x = </code>G, followed by expression F, is 
actually just a different way of writing the expression F<code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code>G.
Thus, <code>val</code> shares all of the behavior of the pruning combinator,
which we have already described. (This is also true when a pattern is used instead
of variable name <code>x</code>).
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Nesting Orc expressions</title>

<para>
The execution of an Orc expression may publish many values. What does such an expression 
mean in a context where only one value is expected? For example, what does <code>2 + (3 | 4)</code> 
publish? 
</para>

<para>
The specific contexts in which we are interested are as follows (where E is any Orc expression):

<informaltable id="value-context-table" frame="none" rowsep="0" colsep="0">

<entry><emphasis>list element</emphasis></entry>
</row>

</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>
</para>

<para>
Whenever an Orc expression appears in such a context, it executes until it publishes its first value, 
and then it is terminated. The published value is used in the context as if it were the result of evaluating
the expression.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Publish either 5 or 6
2 + (3 | 4)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Publish exactly one of 0, 1, 2 or 3
(0 | 2) + (0 | 1)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
To be precise, whenever an Orc expression appears in such a context, it is treated as if it was 
on the right side of a pruning combinator, using a fresh variable name to fill in the hole. 
Thus, C[E] (where E is the Orc expression and C is the context) is equivalent to the expression 
C[<code>x</code>] <code><![CDATA[ <x< ]]></code> E. 
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Functions</title>

<para>
The body of a function in Orc may be any Orc expression; thus, function
bodies in Orc are executed rather than evaluated, and may engage in communication
and publish multiple values.
</para>

<para>
A function call in Orc, as in Cor, binds the values of its actual parameters
to its formal parameters, and then executes the function body with those bindings.
Whenever the function body publishes a value, the function call publishes that
value. Thus, unlike a site call, or a pure functional Cor call, an Orc function
call may publish many values.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Publish all integers in the interval 1..n, in arbitrary order. 
def range(n) = if (n > 0) then (n | range(n-1)) else stop 

-- Publish 1, 2, and 3 in arbitrary order.
range(3)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
In the context of Orc, function calls are not strict. When a function call executes,
it begins to execute the function body immediately, and also executes the argument
expressions in parallel. When an argument expression publishes a value, it is terminated,
and the corresponding formal parameter is bound to that value in the execution of
the function body. Any part of the function body which uses a formal parameter
that has not yet been bound suspends until that parameter is bound to a value.
</para>

</section>



</section>


<section><title>Time</title>

<para>
Orc is designed to communicate with the external world, and one of the
most important characteristics of the external world is the passage of
time. Orc implicitly interacts with the passage of time by calling external
services which take time to respond. However, Orc can also explicitly
wait for some amount of time, using the special site <code>Rtimer</code>. 
</para>

<para>
The site <code>Rtimer</code> is a relative timer. It takes as an argument
a number of milliseconds to wait. It waits for exactly that amount of time,
and then responds with a signal.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
-- Print "red", wait for 3 seconds (3000 ms), and then print "green" 
println("red") >> Rtimer(3000) >> println("green") >> stop
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The following example defines a metronome, which publishes a signal once 
every <code>t</code> milliseconds, indefinitely.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
def metronome(t) = signal | Rtimer(t) >> metronome(t)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
We can also use <code>Rtimer</code> together with the pruning combinator 
to enforce a timeout.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{-
  Publish the result of a Google search.
  If it takes more than 5 seconds, time out.
-}
result 
  <result< ( Google("impatience") 
           | Rtimer(5000) >> "Search timed out.")
]]></programlisting>
</para>

extensions to pattern matching, and new forms of declarations, and ML-style
datatypes.

<section><title>Special call forms</title>

<section><title>The <code>.</code> notation</title>

<para>
In many object-oriented programming languages, one calls a method or accesses a field of an
object using the dot operator; for example, <code>obj.m()</code> calls the method
<code>m</code> of the object <code>obj</code>. 
</para>

<para>
There is a special kind of site call in Orc which serves a similar purpose. One may write
<code>x.msg</code>, for any identifiers <code>x</code> and <code>msg</code>. This treats
 the value bound to <code>x</code> as a site, and calls it with a special 
<firstterm>message</firstterm> value <code>msg</code>. 
If the site understands the message <code>msg</code> (for example, if <code>x</code> is 
bound to a Java object with a field called <code>msg</code>), the site interprets the message 
and responds with some appropriate value. If the site does not 
understand the message sent to it, it does not respond, and no publication occurs. 
If <code>x</code> cannot be interpreted as a site, no call is made. 
</para>

<para>
Typically this capability is used so that sites may be syntactically treated like objects, 
with multiple methods and fields. For example, a channel <code>c</code> might understand the messages
<code>get</code> and <code>put</code>, to get values from and put values on that channel,
respectively. Such calls would be written <code>c.get()</code>, or <code>c.put(6)</code>.
</para>

<para>
A call such as <code>c.put(6)</code> actually occurs in two steps. First <code>c.put</code> sends the message
<code>put</code> to the site <code>c</code>; this publishes a site whose only purpose
is to put values on the channel. Next, that site is called on the argument
<code>6</code>, sending 6 on the channel. Readers familiar with functional programming
will recognize this technique as <emphasis>currying</emphasis>.
</para>
</section>


<section><title>Currying</title>

<para>
It is sometimes useful to <emphasis>stage</emphasis> the arguments to a function; that is,
rather than writing a function on two arguments, one instead writes a function on one
argument which returns a function taking the second argument and performing the remainder
of the evaluation. 
</para>

<para>
This technique is known as <emphasis>currying</emphasis> and it is common in functional
programming languages. We can write curried functions using <link linkend="cor.closures">closures</link>. Suppose we want to 
define a curried addition function on two arguments, and later apply that function to the 
arguments 3 and 4. We could write such a program in the following way:

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def Sum(a) = ( lambda(b) = a+b )  
val f = Sum(3)
f(4)
]]></programlisting>

This defines a function <code>Sum</code> which, given an argument <code>a</code>, creates a function
which will take an argument <code>b</code> and add <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>. It then creates the
function which adds <code>3</code> to its argument, binds that to <code>f</code>, and then invokes
<code>f</code> on <code>4</code> to yield <code>3+4</code>.

</para>

<para>
When defining a curried function, we have abstracted it in two steps, and when
applying it we have written two separate calls. However, this is verbose and
not very clear. Orc has a special syntax for curried function definitions and curried 
applications that will simplify both of these steps. Function definitions may have multiple 
argument sequences; they are enclosed in parentheses and concatenated. Curried function calls 
chain together multiple applications in a similar way. Here is the previous program, written 
in this simplified syntax:

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def Sum(a)(b) = a+b
Sum(3)(4)
]]></programlisting>

Naturally, this syntax is backwards compatible; e.g. both of the following programs are also
equivalent:  

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def Sum(a) = ( lambda(b) = a+b )  
Sum(3)(4)
]]></programlisting>

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def Sum(a)(b) = a+b  
val f = Sum(3)
f(4)
]]></programlisting>

</para>

</section>

<!-- 
Can't find a compelling example for the use of this feature, so this section is commented for now.
However, it is still evident from the grammar that this capability exists.
 -->
<!-- 
<section><title>Expressions as call targets</title>

As a further generalization of calls, we can also write any expression as the target of a call.
In other words, rather than writing an identifier followed by some arguments, a call can even
be a whole expression, whose first publication is used as the site or function to be called.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
 
]]></programlisting>

If the arguments are also expressions, they are executed in parallel with the call target
expression. If the call target expression never publishes, no call occurs.

</section>
 -->

</section>

<section><title>Extensions to pattern matching</title>

<section><title>As pattern</title>

<para>
In taking apart a value with a pattern, it is often useful to capture intermediate results.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
val (a,b) = ((1,2),(3,4))
val (ax,ay) = a
val (bx,by) = b
]]></programlisting>

We can use the <code>as</code> keyword to simplify this program fragment, giving a name to an entire
sub-pattern. Here is an equivalent version of the above code.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
val ((ax,ay) as a, (bx,by) as b) = ((1,2),(3,4))
]]></programlisting>
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Equality pattern</title>

<para>
When a variable occurs in a pattern, it is bound to the value being matched against that pattern. What
if instead we would like to use the value of a bound variable as a test pattern, in a way similar to
a literal value like <code>0</code>? 
</para>

<para>
We can use an equality pattern to do this. An equality pattern is a variable name preceded by <code>=</code>.
Consider the following definition, which compares its argument to the value bound to variable <code>x</code>,
returning <code>true</code> if they are equal and <code>false</code> otherwise.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def isx(=x) = true
def isx(_) = false
]]></programlisting>

</para>

<para>
The equality pattern becomes much more useful when it is embedded within other patterns. For example, consider
this definition <code>withz</code>. If one of the arguments passed to it is equal to <code>z</code>, then the function
returns its other argument. Otherwise it remains silent.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def withz(=z,y) = y
def withz(x,=z) = x
]]></programlisting>

</para>

</section>

<!-- 
<section><title>Site pattern</title>

<para>
A site pattern, written <code>M(p,...,p)</code>, matches any value which was published by a call to the
site <code>M</code> with arguments that match the tuple <code>(p,...,p)</code>. Site patterns only work
for sites which have unique inverses; datatype patterns are a special case of site patterns.
</para>

<para>
Site patterns provide a generalized version of datatype matching, as seen in the <code>case .. of</code>
 or <code>match .. with </code> constructs provided by Haskell and ML.
</para> 

</section>


<section><title>Patterns as views</title>

<para>
In addition to matching data structures constructed within Orc, patterns can also be used to match
external data structures and values. In this setting, a pattern does not necessarily observe the
true structure of the data, but instead provides a <firstterm>view</firstterm> of that data.
</para>

<para>
For example, a list pattern can be used to view some sequentially structured data (such as lines
in a file) as if it were a list. The views allowed on a value are determined by the value itself;
for example, a value which does not support a list view will be refused by any list pattern it
is matched against.
</para>

<para>
The concept of views and view patterns is not new in programming languages; it has been demonstrated
in other languages, most notably <link xlink:href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</link>. In fact, the 
underlying implementation strategy for using sites as view patterns is very similar to the use of
extractor objects and the <code>unapply</code> method in Scala.
</para>

</section>
 -->

</section>



<section id="section.orc.datatypes"><title>Datatypes</title>

<para>
We have seen Orc's predefined data structures: tuples and lists. Orc also provides the capability
for programmers to define their own data structures, using a feature adopted from the ML/Haskell
language family called <firstterm>datatypes</firstterm> (also called variants or tagged sums).
</para>

<para>
Datatypes are defined using the <code>type</code> declaration:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
type Tree = Node(_,_,_) | Empty()
]]></programlisting>

</para>

<para>
This declaration defines two new sites named <code>Node</code> and <code>Empty</code>.
<code>Node</code> takes three arguments, and publishes a <emphasis>tagged value</emphasis>
wrapping those arguments. <code>Empty</code> takes no arguments and does the same.
</para>

<para>
Once we have created these tagged values, we use a new pattern called a datatype pattern
to match them and unwrap the arguments:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
type Tree = Node(_,_,_) | Empty()
{- Build up a small binary tree -}
val l = Node(Empty(), 0, Empty())
val r = Node(Empty(), 2, Empty())
val t = Node(l,1,r)

{- And then match it to extract its contents -}
t >Node(l,j,r)>
l >Node(_,i,_)>
r >Node(_,k,_)>
( i | j | k )
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
One pair of datatypes is so commonly used that it is already predefined in the standard library:
<code>Some(_)</code> and <code>None()</code>. These are used as return values for calls that
need to distinguish between successfully returning a value (<code>Some(v)</code>), and successfully
completing but having no meaningful value to return (<code>None()</code>). For example, a lookup
function might return <code>Some(result)</code> if it found a result, or return <code>None()</code>
if it successfully performed the lookup but found no suitable result.
</para>

</section>




<section><title>New forms of declarations</title>

<section id="section.orc.class"><title><code>class</code> declaration</title>

<para>
When Orc is run on top of an object-oriented programming language, classes
from that language may be used as sites in Orc itself, via the <code>class</code>
declaration. 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- Use the String class from Java's standard library as a site -}
class String = java.lang.String
val s = String("foo")
s.concat("bar")
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
This program binds the variable <code>String</code> to Java's String class.
When it is called as a site, it constructs a new instance of String, passing
the given arguments to the constructor.
</para>

<para>
This instance of String is a Java object; its methods are called and its fields
are accessed using the dot (<code>.</code>) notation, just as one would expect
in Java.  For complete details of how Orc interacts with Java, see
<link linkend="section.services.java">Java Integration</link>.
</para>
</section>


<section><title><code>include</code> declaration</title>

<para>
It is often convenient to group related declarations into units that can be
shared between programs. The <code>include</code> declaration offers a simple
way to do this. It names a source file containing a sequence of Orc declarations;
those declarations are incorporated into the program as if they had textually
replaced the include declaration. An included file may itself contain 
<code>include</code> declarations. 
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- Contents of fold.inc -}
def foldl(f,[],s) = s
def foldl(f,h:t,s) = foldl(f,t,f(h,s))

def foldr(f,l,s) = foldl(f,rev(l),s)
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
{- This is the same as inserting the contents of fold.inc here -}
include "fold.inc"

def sum(L) = foldl(lambda(a,b) = a+b, L, 0)

sum([1,2,3])
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Note that these declarations still obey the rules of lexical scope. Also, Orc 
does not detect shared declarations; if the same file is included twice, its 
declarations occur twice.
</para>

</section>

<chapter id="chapter.methodology"><title>Programming Methodology</title>

<para>
In <link linkend="chapter.language">Chapter 1</link>, we described the syntax and semantics of the Orc language. 
Now, we turn our attention to how the language is used in practice, with guidelines on style and programming 
methodology, including a number of common concurrency patterns.
</para>

<section><title>Syntactic and Stylistic Conventions</title>

<para>
In this section we suggest some syntactic conventions for writing Orc programs. None of these 
conventions are required by the parser; newlines are used only to disambiguate certain corner
cases in parsing, and other whitespace is ignored. However, following programming convention 
helps to improve the readability of programs, so that the programmer's intent is more readily apparent.
</para>

<!--
<section><title>Identifiers</title>

By convention, identifiers bound to sites should begin with a capital letter (e.g. <code>Rtimer</code>,
<code>Google</code>). Similarly, identifiers bound to functions which are strict and publish at 
most one value should also begin with a capital letter. Identifiers bound to functions which are not
strict, or may publish multiple values, should begin with a lowercase letter. Variable names
are typically lowercase but may be made uppercase if it seems stylistically appropriate.

</section>
 -->
 
<section><title>Parallel combinator</title> 
 
<para>
When the combined expressions are small, write them all on one line.

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> | <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> | <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
</programlisting>

Note that we do not need parentheses here, since <code>|</code> is fully associative and commutative.
</para>

<para>
When the combined expressions are large enough to take up a full line, write one expression
per line, with each subsequent expression aligned with the first and preceded by <code>|</code>. 
Indent the first expression to improve readability.

<programlisting>
  <emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis> 
| <emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis>
| <emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis>
</programlisting>
 
</para>

<para>
A sequence of parallel expressions often form the left hand side of a sequential combinator. 
Since the sequential combinator has higher precedence, use parentheses to group the
combined parallel expressions together. 


<programlisting>

<section><title>Sequential combinator</title>

When the combined expressions are small, write a cascade of sequential combinators
all on the same line.
</para> 

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x> ]]><emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis><![CDATA[ >y> ]]><emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>
Remember that sequential is right associative; in this example, <code>x</code> is bound in both G and H, and <code>y</code> is
bound in H.
</para>

<para>
When the combined expressions are large enough to take up a full line, write one expression
per line; each line ends with the combinator which binds the publications
produced by that line.

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis> <![CDATA[ >x> ]]> 
<emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis> <![CDATA[ >y> ]]>
<emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis>
</programlisting>
 
</para>

<para>
For very long-running expressions, or expressions that span multiple lines, write
the combinators on separate lines, indented, between each expression. 

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">very long expression</emphasis> 
 <![CDATA[ >x> ]]> 
<emphasis role="bold">very long expression</emphasis> 
 <![CDATA[ >y> ]]>
<emphasis role="bold">very long expression</emphasis>
</programlisting>
 
</para>

</section>

<section id="style.pruning"><title>Pruning combinator</title>

<para>
When the combined expressions are small, write them on the same line:

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ <x< ]]><emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>
</programlisting>

When multiple pruning combinators are used to bind multiple variables
(especially when the scoped expression is long), start each line with a 
combinator, aligned and indented, and continue with the expression.

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis> 
 <![CDATA[ <x< ]]><emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>
 <![CDATA[ <y< ]]><emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
The pruning combinator is not often written in its explicit form
in Orc programs. Instead, the <code>val</code> declaration is often more
convenient, since it is semantically equivalent and mentions the variable
<code>x</code> before its use in scope, rather than after.

<programlisting>
val x = <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>
val y = <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
<emphasis role="bold">long expression</emphasis> 
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
Additionally, when the variable is used in only one place, and the
expression is small, it is often easier to use a nested expression.
For example,

<programlisting>
val x = <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>
val y = <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
M(x,y)
</programlisting>

is equivalent to

<programlisting>
M(<emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>,<emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>)
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
Sometimes, we use the pruning combinator simply for its capability to terminate
expressions and get a single publication; binding a variable is irrelevant. This
is a special case of nested expressions. We use the identity site <code>let</code>
to put the expression in the context of a function call.
</para>

<para>
For example,

<programlisting>
x<![CDATA[ <x< ]]><emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> | <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> | <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
</programlisting>

is equivalent to

<programlisting>
let(<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> | <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> | <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>)
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The translation uses a pruning combinator, but we don't need to write the combinator, 
name an irrelevant variable, or worry about precedence (since the expression is enclosed
in parentheses as part of the call).
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Declarations</title>

<para>
Declarations should always end with a newline. 

<programlisting>
def add(x,y) = x + y
val z = 7
add(z,z)
</programlisting>

While the parser does not require a newline to end a declaration, it uses the 
newline to disambiguate certain corner cases in parsing, such as function application.
</para>

<para>
When the body of a declaration spans multiple lines, start the body on a new line
after the <code>=</code> symbol, and indent the entire body.

<programlisting>
def f(x,y) =
    <emphasis role="bold">declaration</emphasis>
    <emphasis role="bold">declaration</emphasis>
    <emphasis role="bold">body expression</emphasis>
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
Apply this style recursively; if a def appears within a def, indent its contents even further.

<programlisting>
def f(x,y) =
    <emphasis role="bold">declaration</emphasis>
    def helper(z) =
    	<emphasis role="bold">declaration in helper</emphasis>
    	<emphasis role="bold">declaration in helper</emphasis>
    	<emphasis role="bold">body of helper</emphasis>
    <emphasis role="bold">declaration</emphasis>
    <emphasis role="bold">body expression</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<section><title>Programming Idioms</title>

<para>
In this section we give Orc implementations of some standard idioms from
concurrent and functional programming. Despite the austerity of Orc's four
combinators, we are able to encode a variety of idioms straightforwardly.
</para>

<section><title>Channels</title>

<para>
Orc has no communication primitives like pi-calculus
channels<footnote><para>R. Milner. <emphasis>Communicating and Mobile Systems:
the &#960;-Calculus</emphasis>. Cambridge University Press, May
1999.</para></footnote> or Erlang mailboxes<footnote><para>J. Armstrong, R.
Virding, C. Wikstr¨om, and M. Williams. <emphasis>Concurrent programming in
ERLANG (2nd ed.)</emphasis>. Prentice Hall International (UK) Ltd.,
Hertfordshire, UK, UK, 1996.</para></footnote>. Instead, it makes use of sites
to create channels of communication. 
</para>

<para>
The most frequently used of these sites is <code>Buffer</code>. When called, it
publishes a new asynchronous FIFO channel. That channel is a site with two
methods: <code>get</code> and <code>put</code>.  The call <code>c.get()</code>
takes the first value from channel <code>c</code> and publishes it, or blocks
waiting for a value if none is available. The call <code>c.put(v)</code> puts
<code>v</code> as the last item of <code>c</code> and publishes a signal.
</para>

<para>
A channel may be closed to indicate that it will not be sent any more values.
If the channel <code>c</code> is closed, <code>c.put(v)</code> always halts
(without modifying the state of the channel), and <code>c.get()</code> halts
once <code>c</code> becomes empty. The channel <code>c</code> may be closed by
calling either <code>c.close()</code>, which returns a signal once
<code>c</code> becomes empty, or <code>c.closenb()</code>, which returns a
signal immediately.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Lists</title>

<para>
In the section on Cor, we were introduced to lists: how to construct them,
and how to match them against patterns. While it is certainly feasible to
write a specific function with an appropriate pattern match every time we
want to access a list, it is helpful to have a handful of common operations
on lists and reuse them.
</para>

<para>
One of the most common uses for a list is to send each of its elements through
a sequential combinator. Since the list itself is a single value, we want
to walk through the list and publish each one of its elements in parallel
as a value. The library function <code>each</code> does exactly that.
</para>

<para>
Suppose we want to send the message <code>invite</code> to each email
address in the list <code>inviteList</code>:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
each(inviteList) >address> Email(address, invite)
]]></programlisting>

</para>


<para>
Orc also adopts many of the list idioms of functional programming. The Orc library contains definitions
for most of the standard list functions, such as <code>map</code> and <code>fold</code>. Many of the
list functions internally take advantage of concurrency to make use of any available parallelism; for
example, the <code>map</code> function dispatches all of the mapped calls concurrently, and assembles
the result list once they all return using a fork-join.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Streams</title>

<para>
Sometimes a source of data is not explicitly represented by a list or other data structure. Instead,
it is made available through a site, which returns the values one at a time, each time it is called.
We call such a site a <firstterm>stream</firstterm>. It is analogous to an iterator in a language 
like Java. Functions can also be used as streams, though typically they will not be pure functions,
and should only return one value. A call to a stream may halt, to indicate that the end of the data
has been reached, and no more values will become available. It is often useful to detect the
end of a stream using the otherwise combinator. 
</para>

<para>
Streams are common enough in Orc programming that there is a library function to take all of the
available publications from a stream; it is called <code>repeat</code>, and it is analogous to
<code>each</code> for lists.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def repeat(f) = f() >x> (x | repeat(f))
]]></programlisting>

<para>
The <code>repeat</code> function calls the site or function <code>f</code> with no arguments,
publishes its return value, and recurses to query for more values. <code>repeat</code> should
be used with sites or functions that block until a value is available. Notice that if any
call to <code>f</code> halts, then <code>repeat(f)</code> consequently halts. 
</para>

<para>
For example, it is very easy to treat a channel <code>c</code> as a stream, reading any 
values put on the channel as they become available:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
repeat(c.get)
]]></programlisting>

</para>

<!-- An example of a site that creates streams would be great; file I/O maybe? -->

</section>

<section><title>Arrays</title>

<para>
While lists are a very useful data structure, they are not indexed; it is not possible to get the nth element of
a list in constant time. However, this capability is often needed in practice, so the Orc standard library
provides a function <code>IArray</code> to create immutable arrays. Once initialized, an immutable array cannot
be rewritten; it can only be read. 
</para>

<para>
<code>IArray</code> takes two arguments: an array size, and a function to initialize the array. The function
takes the index being initialized as an argument (indices start at 0), and publishes the value to be stored
at that array position. Here are a few examples:

<programlisting language="orc-demo">
{- Create an array of 10 elements; element i is the ith power of 2 -}
IArray(10, lambda(i) = 2 ** i)
</programlisting>

<programlisting language="orc-demo">
{- Create an array of 5 elements; each element is a newly created buffer -}
IArray(5, lambda(_) = Buffer())
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The array is used like a function; the call <code>A(i)</code> returns the <code>i</code>th element of the
array <code>A</code>. A call with an out-of-bounds index halts. 

<programlisting language="orc-demo">
{- Create an array of 3 buffers -}
val A = IArray(10, lambda(_) = Buffer())

{- Send true on the 0th channel
   and listen for a value on the 0th channel. -}
A(0).put(true) | A(0).get()
</programlisting>
</para>


<para>
Since arrays are accessed by index, there is a library function specifically
designed to make programming with indices easier. The function <code>upto(n)</code> 
publishes all of the numbers from <code>0</code> to
<code>n-1</code> simultaneously; thus, it is very easy to access all of the elements of
an array simultaneously. Suppose we have an array <code>A</code> of <code>n</code> email 
addresses and would like to send the message <code>m</code> to each one.

<programlisting><![CDATA[
upto(n) >i> A(i) >address> Email(address, m)
]]></programlisting>

</para>

</section>



<section><title>Mutable Storage</title>

<para>
Variables in Orc are immutable. There is no assignment operator, and there is no way to
change the value of a bound variable. However, it is often useful to have mutable state
when writing certain algorithms. The Orc library contains two sites that offer simple 
mutable storage: <code>Ref</code> and <code>Cell</code>.
</para>

<para>
The <code>Ref</code> site creates rewritable reference cells.

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
val r = Ref(0)
println(r.read()) >>
r.write(2) >> 
println(r.read()) >>
stop
]]></programlisting>

</para>

<para>
These are very similar to ML's <code>ref</code> cells. <code>r.write(v)</code> stores
the value <code>v</code> in the reference <code>r</code>, overwriting any previous
value, and publishes a signal. <code>r.read()</code> publishes the current value stored
in <code>r</code>.
</para>

<para>
However, unlike in ML, a reference cell can be left initially empty by calling <code>Ref</code>
with no arguments. A read operation on an empty cell blocks until the cell is written.

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
{- Create a cell, and wait 1 second before initializing it. -}
{- The read operation blocks until the write occurs. -}
val r = Ref()
r.read() | Rtimer(1000) >> r.write(1) >> stop
]]></programlisting>

</para>

<para>
The Orc library also offers write-once reference cells, using the <code>Cell</code> site.
A write-once cell has no initial value. Read operations block until the cell has been
written. A write operation succeeds only if the cell is empty; subsequent write operations
simply halt.

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
{- Create a cell, try to write to it twice, and read it -}
{- The read will block until a write occurs
   and only one write will succeed. -}
val r = Cell()
  Rtimer(1000) >> r.write(2) >> println("Wrote 2") >> stop
| Rtimer(1000) >> r.write(3) >> println("Wrote 3") >> stop
| r.read()
]]></programlisting>

Write-once cells are very useful for concurrent programming, and they are often safer
than rewritable reference cells, since the value cannot be changed once it has been
written. The use of write-once cells for concurrent programming is not a new idea;
they have been studied extensively in the context of the 
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_programming_language">Oz programming language</link>.
</para>

<para>
A word of caution: References, cells, and other mutable objects may be accessed concurrently
by many different parts of an Orc program, so race conditions may arise. 
</para> 

<section><title>Reference Syntax</title>

<para>Orc provides syntactic sugar for reading and writing mutable storage:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><code>x?</code> is equivalent to <code>x.read()</code>. This operator
is of equal precedence with the dot operator and function application, so
you can write things like <code>x.y?.v?</code>. This operator is very similar
to the C languages's <code>*</code> operator, but is postfix instead of prefix.
	</listitem>
<listitem><code>x := y</code> is equivalent to <code>x.write(y)</code>.
This operator has higher precedence than the concurrency combinators and if/then/else,
but lower precedence than any of the other operators.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Here is a previous example rewritten using this syntactic sugar:</para>

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
{- Create a cell, try to write to it twice, and read it -}
{- The read will block until a write occurs
   and only one write will succeed. -}
val r = Cell()
  Rtimer(1000) >> r := 2 >> println("Wrote 2") >> stop
| Rtimer(1000) >> r := 3 >> println("Wrote 3") >> stop
| r?
]]></programlisting>

</section>
</section>

<section><title>Loops</title>

<para>
Orc does not have any explicit looping constructs. Most of the time, where a loop
might be used in other languages, Orc programs use one of two strategies: 
</para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>When the iterations of the loops can occur in parallel, write an expression
that expands the data into a sequence of publications, and
use a sequential operator to do something for each publication. This is the strategy
that uses functions like <code>each</code>, <code>repeat</code>, and <code>upto</code>.
</listitem>
<listitem>When the iterations of the loops must occur in sequence, write a tail
recursive function that iterates over the data. Any loop can be rewritten as a 
tail recursion. Typically the data of interest is in a list, so one of the standard
list functions, such as <code>foldl</code>, applies. The library also defines a
function <code>while</code>, which handles many of the common use cases of
while loops.
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

</section>

<section><title>Parallel Matching</title>

<para>
Matching a value against multiple patterns, as we have seen it so far, is a linear
process, and requires a <code>def</code> whose clauses have patterns in their
argument lists. Such a match is linear; each pattern is tried in order until
one succeeds.
</para>

<para>
What if we want to match a value against multiple patterns in parallel, executing
every clause that succeeds? Fortunately, this is very easy to do in Orc. Suppose
we have an expression F which publishes pairs of integers, and we want to publish
a signal for each 3 that occurs. 
</para>

<para>
We could write:

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >(x,y)>
  ( if(x=3) >> signal
  | if(y=3) >> signal ) 
]]>
</programlisting>

But there is a more general alternative:

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x>
  ( x >(3,_)> signal
  | x >(_,3)> signal ) 
]]>
</programlisting>

The interesting case is the pair <code>(3,3)</code>, which is counted twice
because both patterns match it in parallel.
</para>

<para>
This parallel matching technique is sometimes used as an alternative to pattern matching using function
clauses, but only when the patterns are mutually exclusive.
</para>

<para>

For example,

<programlisting  language="orc-demo">
def helper([]) = 0
def helper([_]) = 1
def helper(_:_:_) = 2
helper([4,6])
</programlisting>

is equivalent to

<programlisting  language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
[4,6] >x>
  x >[]> 0
| x >[_]> 1
| x >_:_:_> 2
]]></programlisting>

whereas

<programlisting  language="orc-demo">
def helper([]) = 0
def helper([_]) = 1
def helper(_) = 2
helper([5])
</programlisting>

is <emphasis>not</emphasis> equivalent to

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
[5] >x>
  x >[]> 0
| x >[_]> 1
| x >_> 2
]]></programlisting>

because the clauses are not mutually exclusive. Function clauses must attempt to match in linear order, whereas
this expression matches all of the patterns in parallel. Here, it will match <code>[5]</code> two different ways,
publishing both <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Fork-join</title>

<para>
One of the most common concurrent idioms is a <firstterm>fork-join</firstterm>: run two processes concurrently,
and wait for a result from each one. This is very easy to express in Orc. Whenever we write a <code>val</code>
declaration, the process computing that value runs in parallel with the rest of the program. So if we write
two <code>val</code> declarations, and then form a tuple of their results, this performs a fork-join.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
val x = <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>
val y = <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>
(x,y)
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Fork-joins are a fundamental part of all Orc programs, since they are created by all nested expression
translations. In fact, the fork-join we wrote above could be expressed even more simply as just:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
(<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>,<emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>)
</programlisting>
</para>


<section><title>Example: Machine initialization</title>

<para>
In Orc programs, we often use fork-join and recursion together to dispatch many tasks in parallel and wait
for all of them to complete. Suppose that given a machine <code>m</code>, calling <code>m.init()</code> 
initializes <code>m</code> and then publishes a signal when initialization is complete. The function 
<code>initAll</code> initializes a list of machines.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def initAll([]) = signal
def initAll(m:ms) = ( m.init() , initAll(ms) ) >> signal
]]></programlisting>

<para>
For each machine, we fork-join the initialization of that machine (<code>m.init()</code>) with the initialization
of the remaining machines (<code>initAll(ms)</code>). Thus, all of the initializations proceed in parallel, and
the function returns a signal only when every machine in the list has completed its initialization. 
</para>

<para>
Note that if some machine fails to initialize, and does not return a signal, then the initialization procedure
will never complete. 
</para> 

</section>

<section id="example.auction"><title>Example: Simple parallel auction</title>

<para>
We can also use a recursive fork-join to obtain a value, rather than just signaling completion. Suppose we
have a list of bidders in a sealed-bid, single-round auction. Calling <code>b.ask()</code> requests a bid
from the bidder <code>b</code>. We want to ask for one bid from each bidder, and then return the highest
bid. The function <code>auction</code> performs such an auction for a list of bidders (<code>max</code> 
finds the maximum of its arguments):
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def auction([]) = 0
def auction(b:bs) = max(b.ask(), auction(bs))
]]></programlisting>

</section>

<para>
Note that all bidders are called simultaneously. Also note that if some bidder fails 
to return a bid, then the auction will never complete.  Later we will see
a <link linkend="example.auction-with-timeout">different solution</link> that addresses the issue of non-termination.
</para>

<section><title>Example: Barrier synchronization</title>

<para>
Consider an expression of the following form, where F and G are expressions and M and N are sites:

<programlisting>
M() <![CDATA[ >x> ]]> <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> | N() <![CDATA[ >y> ]]> <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>
Suppose we would like to <emphasis>synchronize</emphasis> F and G, so that both start
executing at the same time, after both <code>M()</code> and <code>N()</code> respond.  This is easily done
using the fork-join idiom. In the following, we assume that <code>x</code> does not occur
free in G, nor <code>y</code> in F.

<programlisting>
( M() , N() ) <![CDATA[ >(x,y)> ]]> ( <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> | <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> )
</programlisting>

</para>

</section>

</section>

<section><title>Sequential Fork-Join</title>

<para>
Previous sections illustrate how Orc can use the fork-join idiom to process a
fixed set of expressions or a list of values.  Suppose that instead we wish to
process all the publications of an expression F, and once this processing is
complete, execute some expression G.  For example, F publishes the contents
of a text file, one line at a time, and we wish to print each line to the
console using the site <code>println</code>, then publish a signal after all lines
have been printed.
</para>

<para>
Sequential composition alone is not sufficient, because we have no way to
detect when all of the lines have been processed.  A recursive fork-join
solution would require that the lines be stored in a traversable data structure
like a list, rather than streamed as publications from F.  A better solution
uses the <code>;</code> combinator to detect when processing is complete:
</para>

<programlisting>
<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> >x> println(x) >> stop ; signal
</programlisting>

<para>
Since <code>;</code> only evaluates its right side if the left side does not publish,
we suppress the publications on the left side using <code>stop</code>. Here, we
assume that we can detect when F halts. If, for example,
F is publishing the lines of the file as it receives them over a socket,
and the sending party never closes the socket, then F never halts and no
signal is published.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Priority Poll</title>

<para>
The otherwise combinator is also useful for trying alternatives in sequence. Consider an expression of
the form <code>F<subscript>0</subscript> ; F<subscript>1</subscript> ; F<subscript>2</subscript> ; ...</code>. If F<subscript>i</subscript> does not publish 
and halts, then F<subscript>i+1</subscript> is executed. We can think of the F<subscript>i</subscript>'s as a series of 
alternatives that are explored until a publication occurs.
</para>

<para>
Suppose that we would like to poll a list of buffers for available data.  The
list of buffers is ordered by priority. The first buffer in the list has the
highest priority, so it is polled first.  If it has no data, then the
next buffer is polled, and so on.
</para>

<para>
Here is a function which polls a prioritized list of buffers in this way. It
publishes the first item that it finds, removing it from the originating
buffer. If all buffers are empty, the function halts.  We use the <code>getnb</code> ("get non-blocking") method of the buffer, which retrieves the first
available item if there is one, and halts otherwise.
</para>

<programlisting>
def priorityPoll([]) = stop
def priorityPoll(b:bs) = b.getnb() ; priorityPoll(bs)
</programlisting>
</section>

<section><title>Parallel Or</title>

<para>
``Parallel or'' is a classic idiom of parallel programming.  The ``parallel or'' operation executes two
expressions F and G in parallel, each of which may publish a single boolean,
and returns the disjunction of their publications as soon as possible. 
If one of the expressions publishes <code>true</code>, then the disjunction is <code>true</code>, 
so it is not necessary to wait for the other expression to publish a value. 
This holds even if one of the expressions is silent.
</para>

<para>
The ``parallel or'' of expressions F and G may be expressed in Orc as
follows:
</para>

<programlisting>
let(
    val a = <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>
    val b = <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>

      (a || b)
    | if(a)<![CDATA[ >> ]]>true 
    | if(b)<![CDATA[ >> ]]>true 
)
</programlisting>

<para>
The expression <code>(a || b)</code> waits for both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to become
available and then publishes their disjunction.  However if either <code>a</code> or
<code>b</code> is true we can publish <code>true</code> immediately regardless of whether the
other variable is available.  Therefore we run <code>if(a) >> true</code> and <code>if(b) >> true</code>
in parallel to wait for either variable to become <code>true</code> and immediately
publish the result <code>true</code>.  Since more than one of these expressions may
publish <code>true</code>, the surrounding <code>let(...)</code> is necessary to select and
publish only the first result.
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Timeout</title>

<para>
<firstterm>Timeout</firstterm>, the ability to execute an expression for at most a specified
amount of time, is an essential ingredient of fault-tolerant and distributed
programming.  Orc accomplishes timeout using pruning and the <code>Rtimer</code> site.
The following program runs F for at most one second, publishing its result if
available and the value <code>0</code> otherwise.
</para>

<programlisting>
let( <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> | Rtimer(1000)<![CDATA[ >> ]]>0 )
</programlisting>


<section id="example.auction-with-timeout"><title>Auction with timeout</title>

<para>
In the <link linkend="example.auction">auction example</link> given previously, the auction may never complete if 
one of the bidders does not respond. We can add a timeout so that a bidder has at most 8 seconds to provide a bid:
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def auction([]) = 0
def auction(b:bs) = 
  val bid = b.ask() | Rtimer(8000) >> 0
  max(bid, auction(bs))
]]></programlisting>

<para>
This version of the auction is guaranteed to complete within 8 seconds.
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Detecting timeout</title>

<para>
Sometimes, rather than just yielding a default value, we would like to
determine whether an expression has timed out, and if so, perform some other
computation.  To detect the timeout, we pair the result of the original
expression with <code>true</code> and the result of the timer with <code>false</code>.
Thus, if the expression does time out, then we can distinguish that case
using the boolean value.
</para>

<para>
Here, we run expression F with a time limit <code>t</code>. If it publishes
within the time limit, we bind its result to <code>r</code> and execute G.
Otherwise, we execute H.

<programlisting>
val (r, b) = (<emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>, true) | (Rtimer(t), false)
if b then <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> else <emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
</programlisting>

Instead of using a boolean and conditional, we could use pattern matching:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
val s = Some(]]><emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[) | Rtimer(t) >> None()
  s >Some(r)> ]]><emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis><![CDATA[
| s >None()>  ]]><emphasis role="bold">H</emphasis>
</programlisting>

</para>

 
</section>

</section>

<section><title>Priority</title>

<para>
We can use a timer to give a window of priority to one computation over
another.  In this example, we run expressions F and G concurrently.  For
one second, F has priority; F's result is published immediately,
but G's result is held until the time interval has elapsed.  If neither F nor
G publishes a result within one second, then the first result from either
is published.

<programlisting>
val x = <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>
val y = <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>
let( y | Rtimer(1000) >> x )
</programlisting>

</para>

</section>


<section><title>Metronome</title>

<para>
A timer can be used to execute an expression repeatedly at regular
intervals, for example to poll a service.
Recall the definition of <code>metronome</code> from the previous chapter:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def metronome(t) = signal | Rtimer(t) >> metronome()
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The following example publishes "tick" once per second and "tock" once per
second after an initial half-second delay.  The publications alternate: "tick
tock tick tock ...". Note that this program is not defined recursively;
the recursion is entirely contained within <code>metronome</code>.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
  metronome(1000) >> "tick"
| Rtimer(500) >> metronome(1000) >> "tock"
]]></programlisting>
</para>

</section>





<section><title>Routing</title>

<para>
The Orc combinators restrict the passing of values among their component
expressions. However, some programs will require greater
flexibility.  For example, <code>F &lt;x&lt; G</code> provides F with the first 
publication of G, but what if F needs the first n publications of G?  
In cases like this we use channels or other stateful sites to redirect or 
store publications.  We call this technique <firstterm>routing</firstterm>
because it involves routing values from one execution to another.
</para>

<section><title>Generalizing Termination</title>

<para>
The pruning combinator terminates an expression after it publishes its first
value. We have <link linkend="style.pruning">already seen</link> how to use 
pruning just for its termination capability, without binding a variable, using 
the <code>let</code> site. Now, we use routing to terminate an expression
under different conditions, not just when it publishes a value; it may
publish many values, or none, before being terminated.
</para>

<para>
Our implementation strategy is to route the publications of the expression
through a channel, so that we can put the expression inside a pruning combinator
and still see its publications without those publications terminating the
expression. 
</para>

<section><title>Enhanced Timeout</title>

<para>
As a simple demonstration of this concept, we construct a more powerful form 
of timeout: allow an expression to execute, publishing arbitrarily many values 
(not just one), until a time limit is reached.
</para>

<programlisting>
val c = Buffer()
repeat(c.get)<![CDATA[ << ]]>
    <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x> c.put(x) >> stop 
  | Rtimer(1000) >> c.closenb()]]></programlisting>

<para>
This program allows F to execute for one second and then terminates it. Each
value published by F is routed through channel <code>c</code> so that it does
not terminate F. After one second, <code>Rtimer(1000)</code> responds,
triggering the call <code>c.closenb()</code>.  The call
<code>c.closenb()</code> closes <code>c</code> and publishes a signal,
terminating F.  The library function <code>repeat</code> is used to repeatedly
take and publish values from <code>c</code> until it is closed.
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Test Pruning</title>

<para>
We can also decide to terminate based on the values published. This expression
executes F until it publishes a negative number, and then terminates it:
</para>

<programlisting>
val c = Buffer()
repeat(c.get)<![CDATA[ << ]]>
  <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x> 
    (if x >= 0 
        then c.put(x) >> stop
        else c.closenb())]]>
</programlisting>

<para>
Each value published by F is tested. If it is non-negative, it is placed on
channel <code>c</code> (silently) and read by <code>repeat(c.get)</code>. 
If it is negative, the channel is closed, publishing a signal and causing
the termination of F.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Interrupt</title>

<para>
We can use routing to interrupt an expression based on a signal from
elsewhere in the program.  We set up the expression like a timeout, but instead
of waiting for a timer, we wait for the semaphore <code>done</code> to be released. Any
call to <code>done.release</code> will terminate the expression (because it will
cause <code>done.acquire()</code> to publish), but otherwise F executes as normal and
may publish any number of values.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
val c = Buffer()
val done = Semaphore(0)
repeat(c.get) <<
    ]]><emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x> c.put(x) >> stop
  | done.acquire() >> c.closenb()]]></programlisting>

</section>

<section><title>Publication Limit</title>

<para>
We can limit an expression to <emphasis>n</emphasis> publications,
rather than just one. Here is an expression which executes F until
it publishes 5 values, and then terminates it.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
val c = Buffer()
val done = Semaphore(0)
def allow(0) = done.release() >> stop
def allow(n) = c.get() >!x> allow(n-1)
allow(5) << ]]>
    <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x> c.put(x) >> stop 
  | done.acquire() >> c.closenb()
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>
We use the auxiliary function <code>allow</code> to get only the first 5
publications from the channel <code>c</code>.  When no more publications are allowed,
<code>allow</code> uses the interrupt idiom to halt F and close <code>c</code>.
</para>

</section>


</section>


<section><title>Non-Terminating Pruning</title>

<para>
We can use routing to create a modified version of the pruning combinator.
As in <code>F &lt;x&lt; G</code>, we'll run F and G in parallel and make the first
value published by G available to F.  However instead of terminating G after
it publishes a value, we will continue running it, ignoring its remaining
publications.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
val r = Ref()
(]]><emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ <x< r.read()) | (]]><emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x> r.write(x))
]]>
</programlisting>

</section>

<section><title>Publication-Agnostic Otherwise</title>

<para>
We can also use routing to create a modified version of the otherwise combinator. We'll
run F until it halts, and then run G, regardless of whether F published any values
or not.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
val c = Buffer()
repeat(c.get) | (]]><emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis><![CDATA[ >x> c.put(x) >> stop ; c.close() >> ]]><emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis>)  
</programlisting>

We use <code>c.close()</code> instead of the more common <code>c.closenb()</code>
to ensure that G does not execute until all the publications of F have been
routed. Recall that <code>c.close()</code> does not return until <code>c</code> is
empty.

</section>

</section>

<section><title>Interruption</title>

<para>
We can write a function <code>interruptible</code> that implements the interrupt idiom
to execute any function in an interruptible way.  <code>interruptible(g)</code>
calls the function <code>g</code>, which is assumed to take no arguments, and
silences its publications. It immediately publishes another function, which we
can call at any time to terminate the execution of <code>g</code>. For simplicity,
we assume that <code>g</code> itself publishes no values.
</para>

<para>
Here is a naive implementation that doesn't quite work:
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def interruptible(f) =
  val done = Semaphore(0)
  done.release
    << f() >> stop 
     | done.acquire() >> c.closenb()

{- wrong! -}
val stopper = interruptible(g)
...
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>
The function <code>interruptible</code> is correct, but the way it is used causes a strange error.
The function <code>g</code> executes, but is always immediately terminated! This happens because the
<code>val</code> declaration which binds <code>stopper</code> also kills all of the remaining
computation in <code>interruptible(g)</code>, including the execution of <code>g</code> itself.
</para>

<para>
The solution is to bind the variable differently:
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def interruptible(f) =
  val done = Semaphore(0)
  done.release
    << f() >> stop 
     | done.acquire() >> c.closenb()

interruptible(g) >stopper>
...
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>
This idiom, wherein a function publishes some value that can be used to monitor or control its 
execution, arises occasionally in Orc programming. When using this idiom, always remember to
avoid terminating that execution accidentally. Since Orc is a structured concurrent language,
every process is contained with some other process; kill the containing process, and the
contained processes die too.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Lifting</title>

It is often useful to explicitly lift an execution, so that it is in some sense protected from
being terminated. We can do this by running a "lifter" process, to which we can send functions
that will be executed by the lifter and thus will not be terminated unless the lifter itself
is terminated.

Such a lifter is written by creating a channel, and running a loop which listens for functions to
be sent on the channel and executes those functions as they arrive. The lifter publishes only
the put method for the channel; the loop itself publishes no values, since the values published by the 
lifted functions are silenced.

Here, we write such a lifter, and then use it to protect a function call from a timeout.

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def lifter() =
  val c = Buffer()
  def loop() = c.get() >f> ( f() >> stop | loop() )
  c.put | loop()

def delayedPrint() = Rtimer(1500) >> println("Delayed 1.5 seconds")

lifter() >lift>
(
println("Running...") 
  << Rtimer(1000) | delayedPrint() | lift(delayedPrint)
)
]]>
</programlisting>

The timeout stops the execution of <code>delayedPrint()</code>, so it does not print a result.
However, the lifted execution of <code>delayedPrint</code> does succeed, since it is executing
within the loop of <code>lifter()</code>, unaffected by the timeout.

</section>

<section><title>Fold</title>

<para>
We consider various concurrent implementations of the classic "list fold"
function from functional programming:
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def fold(_, [x])  = x
def fold(f, x:xs) = f(x, fold(xs))]]></programlisting>

<para>
This is a seedless fold (sometimes called <code>fold1</code>) which requires that the
list be nonempty and uses its first element as a seed.  This implementation is
short-circuiting --- it may finish early if the reduction operator <code>f</code> does
not use its second argument --- but it is not concurrent; no two calls to <code>f</code>
can proceed in parallel.
</para>

<section><title>Associative Fold</title>

<para>
We first consider the case when the reduction operator is associative.  We
define <code>afold(b,xs)</code> where <code>b</code> is a binary associative function and
<code>xs</code> is a non-empty list.  The implementation iteratively reduces <code>xs</code>
to a single value.  Each step of the iteration applies the auxiliary function
<code>step</code>, which halves the size of <code>xs</code> by reducing disjoint pairs of
adjacent items. Notice that <code>b(x,y):step(xs)</code> is an implicit
fork-join. Thus, the call <code>b(x,y)</code>
executes in parallel with the recursive call <code>step(xs)</code>, and as a result,
all of the calls to <code>b</code> in each iteration occur in parallel. 
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def afold(b, [x]) = x
def afold(b, xs) =
  def step([]) = []
  def step([x]) = [x]
  def step(x:y:xs) = b(x,y):step(xs)
  afold(b, step(xs))]]></programlisting>
</section>

<section><title>Associative, Commutative Fold</title>

<para>
We can devise a better strategy when the fold operator is both associative and
commutative. We define <code>cfold(b,xs)</code>, where <code>b</code> is a binary associative and
commutative function over two arguments and <code>xs</code> is a non-empty list. 
The implementation initially copies all list items into a buffer in arbitrary
order using the auxiliary function <code>xfer</code>.  The auxiliary function
<code>combine</code> repeatedly pulls pairs of items from the buffer, reduces
them, and places the result back in the buffer. Each pair of items is reduced
in parallel as they become available.  The last item in the buffer is the
result of the overall fold.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def cfold(b, xs) =
  val c = Buffer()
  
  def xfer([])    = stop
  def xfer(x:xs)  = c.put(x) >> stop | xfer(xs)

  def combine(1) =  c.get()
  def combine(m) =  c.get() >x> c.get() >y> 
                    ( c.put(b(x,y)) >> stop | combine(m-1))

  xfer(xs) | combine(length(xs))]]></programlisting>

<section><title>Larger Examples</title>

In this section we show a few larger Orc programs to demonstrate programming techniques. 
There are many more such examples available at the Orc website, on the

<section><title>Dining Philosophers</title>

<para>
The dining philosophers problem is a well known and intensely studied problem
in concurrent programming. Five philosophers sit around a circular table. Each
philosopher has two forks that she shares with her neighbors (giving five forks
in total).  Philosophers think until they become hungry.  A hungry philosopher
picks up both forks, one at a time, eats, puts down both forks, and then
resumes thinking.  Without further refinement, this scenario allows deadlock;
if all philosophers become hungry and pick up their left-hand forks
simultaneously, no philosopher will be able to pick up her right-hand fork to
eat.  Lehmann and Rabin's solution<footnote><para>D. J. Lehmann and M. O. Rabin. On the advantages of free choice: A symmetric
and fully distributed solution to the dining philosophers problem. In <emphasis>POPL</emphasis>, pages
133–138, 1981.</para></footnote>, which we implement,
requires that each philosopher pick up her forks in a random order.  If the
second fork is not immediately available, the philosopher must set down both
forks and try again.  While livelock is still possible if all philosophers
take forks in the same order, randomization makes this possibility vanishingly
unlikely.
</para>

<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def shuffle(a,b) = if (random(2) = 1) then (a,b) else (b,a)

def take((a,b)) =    
  a.acquire() >> b.acquirenb() ;
  a.release() >> take(shuffle(a,b))
    
def drop(a,b) = (a.release(), b.release()) >> signal

def phil(n,a,b) =
  def thinking() = 
    println(n + " thinking") >> 
    if (random(10) < 9)
      then Rtimer(random(1000))
      else stop
  def hungry() = take((a,b))
  def eating() = 
    println(n + " eating") >> 
    Rtimer(random(1000)) >> 
    println(n + " done eating") >> 
    drop(a,b)
  thinking() >> hungry() >> eating() >> phil(n,a,b)

def philosophers(1,a,b) = phil(1,a,b)
def philosophers(n,a,b) =
  val c = Semaphore(1)
  philosophers(n-1,a,c) | phil(n,c,b)

val fork = Semaphore(1)
philosophers(5,fork,fork)]]></programlisting>

<para>
The <code>phil</code> function simulates a single philosopher.  It takes as arguments
two binary semaphores representing the philosopher's forks, and calls
the <code>thinking</code>, <code>hungry</code>, and <code>eating</code> functions in a continuous
loop. A <code>thinking</code> philosopher waits for a random amount of time, with a
10% chance of thinking forever. A <code>hungry</code> philosopher uses the <code>take</code>
function to acquire two forks. An <code>eating</code> philosopher waits for a random
time interval and then uses the <code>drop</code> function to relinquish ownership of
her forks.
</para>

<para>
Calling <code>take</code> attempts to acquire a pair of forks <code>(a,b)</code> in two steps:
wait for fork <code>a</code> to become available, then immediately attempt to acquire fork <code>b</code>.
The call <code>b.acquirenb()</code> either acquires <code>b</code> and responds immediately, or halts if <code>b</code> is not available.
If <code>b</code> is acquired, signal success; otherwise, release <code>a</code>, and
then try again, randomly changing the order in which the forks are acquired
using the auxiliary function <code>shuffle</code>.
</para>

<para>
The function <code>philosophers</code> recursively creates a chain of <code>n</code>
philosophers, bounded by fork <code>a</code> on the left and <code>b</code> on the right. The
goal expression of the program calls <code>philosophers</code> to create a chain of
five philosophers bounded on the left and right by the same fork; hence, a
ring.
</para>

<para>
This Orc solution has several nice properties.  The overall structure of the
program is functional, with each behavior encapsulated in its own function,
making the program easy to understand and modify.  Mutable state is isolated to
the "fork" semaphores and associated <code>take</code> and <code>get</code> functions,
simplifying the implementation of the philosophers.  The program never
manipulates threads explicitly, but instead expresses relationships between
activities using Orc's combinators.
</para>

</section>

<section id="methodology.examples.hygenic"><title>Hygienic Dining Philosophers</title>

<para>
Here we implement a different solution to the Dining Philosophers problem,
described in "The Drinking Philosophers Problem", by K. M. Chandy and J. Misra.
Briefly, this algorithm efficiently and fairly solves the dining philosophers
problem for philosophers connected in an arbitrary graph (as opposed to a
simple ring).  The algorithm works by augmenting each fork with a clean/dirty
state.  Initially, all forks are dirty.  A philosopher is only obliged to
relinquish a fork to its neighbor if the fork is dirty. On receiving a fork,
the philosopher cleans it. On eating, the philosopher dirties all forks.  For
full details of the algorithm, consult the original paper.

<para>
Our implementation is based on the <link
xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</link> of
concurrency.  An actor is a state machine which reacts to messages.  On
receiving a message, an actor can send asynchronous messages to other actors,
change its state, or create new actors.  Each actor is single-threaded and
processes messages sequentially, which makes some concurrent programs easier to
reason about and avoids explicit locking. <link
	xlink:href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</link> is one popular
language based on the actor model.
</para>

<para>
Orc emulates the actor model very naturally.  In Orc, an actor is an Orc thread
of execution, together with a <code>Buffer</code> which serves as a mailbox.  To send a
message to an actor, you place it in the actor's mailbox, and to receive a
message, the actor gets the next item from the mailbox.  The internal states of
the actor are represented by functions: while an actor's thread of execution is
evaluating a function, it is considered to be in the corresponding state.
Because Orc implements <link
xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail-call optimization</link>,
state transitions can be encoded as function calls without running out of stack
space.
</para>

<para>
In this program, a philosopher is implemented by an actor with three primary
states: <code>eating</code>, <code>thinking</code>, and <code>hungry</code>.
An additional transient state, <code>digesting</code>, is used to start a timer
which will trigger the state change from <code>thinking</code> to
<code>hungry</code>.  Each state is implemented by a function which reads a
message from the mailbox, selects the appropriate action using pattern
matching, performs the action, and finally transitions to the next state
(possibly the same as the current state) by calling the corresponding function.
</para>

<para>
Forks are never represented explicitly.  Instead each philosopher identifies a
fork with the "address" (sending end of a mailbox) of the neighbor who shares
the fork.  Every message sent includes the sender's address.  Therefore when a
philosopher receives a request for a fork, it knows who requested it and
therefore which fork to relinquish.  Likewise when a philosopher receives a
fork, it knows who sent it and therefore which fork was received.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Readers-Writers</title>

<para>
Here we present an Orc solution to the <link
xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers-writers_problem">readers-writers
problem</link>.  Briefly, the readers-writers problem involves concurrent
access to a mutable resource.  Multiple readers can access the resource
concurrently, but writers must have exclusive access.  When readers and writers
conflict, different solutions may resolve the conflict in favor of one or the
other, or fairly.  In the following solution, when a writer tries to acquire
the lock, current readers are allowed to finish but new readers are postponed
until after the writer finishes.  Lock requests are granted in the order
received, guaranteeing fairness.  Normally, such a service would be provided to
Orc programs by a site, but it is educational to see how it can be implemented
directly in Orc.

<para>
The lock receives requests over the channel <code>m</code> and processes them
sequentially with the function <code>grant</code>. Each request includes a
boolean flag which is true for write requests and false for read requests, and a
<code>Semaphore</code> which the requester blocks on.  The lock grants access
by releasing the semaphore, unblocking the requester.
</para>

<para>
The counter <code>c</code> tracks the number of readers or writers currently
holding the lock.  Whenever the lock is granted, <code>grant</code> increments
<code>c</code>, and when the lock is released, <code>c</code> is decremented.
To ensure that a writer has exclusive access, <code>grant</code> waits for the
<code>c</code> to become zero before granting the lock to the writer, and then
waits for <code>c</code> to become zero again before granting any more requests.

<section><title>Quicksort</title>

<para>
The original quicksort algorithm
<footnote><para>C. A. R. Hoare. Partition: Algorithm 63, Quicksort: Algorithm 64, and
Find: Algorithm 65. <emphasis>Communications of the ACM</emphasis>,
4(7):321–322, 1961.</para></footnote>
was designed for efficient execution on a uniprocessor.
Encoding it as a functional program typically ignores its efficient
rearrangement of the elements of an array.
Further, no known implementation highlights its concurrent aspects.
The following program attempts to overcome these two limitations.
The program is mostly functional in its structure, though it manipulates the
array elements in place.
We encode parts of the algorithm as concurrent activities where sequentiality
is unneeded.
</para>

<para>
The following listing gives the implementation of the <code>quicksort</code>
function which sorts the array <code>a</code> in place.
The auxiliary function <code>sort</code> sorts the subarray given by indices
<code>s</code> through <code>t</code> by calling <code>part</code> to partition
the subarray and then recursively sorting the partitions.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
def quicksort(a) =

  def swap(x, y) = a(x)? >z> a(x) := a(y)? >> a(y) := z

  def part(p, s, t) =
    def lr(i) = if i < t && a(i)? <= p then lr(i+1) else i
    def rl(i) = if a(i)? > p then rl(i-1) else i

    (lr(s), rl(t)) >(s', t')>
    ( if (s' + 1 < t') >> swap(s', t') >> part(p, s'+1, t'-1)
    | if (s' + 1 = t') >> swap(s', t') >> s'
    | if (s' + 1 > t') >> t'
    )

  def sort(s, t) =
     if s >= t then signal
     else part(a(s)?, s+1, t) >m>
          swap(m, s) >>
          (sort(s, m-1), sort(m+1, t)) >>
          signal

  sort(0, a.length()-1)]]></programlisting>

<para>
The function <code>part</code> partitions the subarray given by indices
<code>s</code> through <code>t</code> into two partitions, one containing values
less than or equal to <code>p</code> and the other containing values &gt; <code>p</code>.  The last index of the lower partition is returned.
The value at <code>a(s-1)</code> is assumed to be less than or equal to <code>p</code> --- this is satisfied
by choosing <code>p = a(s-1)?</code> initially.  To create the partitions, <code>part</code>
calls two auxiliary functions <code>lr</code> and <code>rl</code> concurrently.  These
functions scan from the left and right of the subarray respectively, looking
for out-of-place elements.  Once two such elements have been found, they are
swapped using the auxiliary function <code>swap</code>, and then the unscanned portion
of the subarray is partitioned further.  Partitioning is complete when the
entire subarray has been scanned.
</para>

<para>
This program uses the syntactic sugar <code>x?</code> for <code>x.read()</code>
and <code>x := y</code> for <code>x.write(y)</code>.  Also note that the expression
<code>a(i)</code> returns a reference to the element of array <code>a</code> at index
<code>i</code>, counting from 0.
</para>

<section><title>Meeting Scheduler</title>

<para>
Orc makes very few assumptions about the behaviors of services it uses. Therefore
it is straightforward to write programs which interact with human agents and
network services.  This makes Orc especially suitable for encoding
<firstterm>workflows</firstterm>, the coordination of multiple activities
involving multiple participants.  The following program illustrates a simple
workflow for scheduling a business meeting.  Given a list of people and a date
range, the program asks each person when they are available for a meeting.  It
then combines all the responses, selects a meeting time which is acceptable to
everyone, and notifies everyone of the selected time.
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
include "net.inc"
val during = Interval(LocalDate(2009, 9, 10),
                      LocalDate(2009, 10, 17))
val invitees = ["john@example.com", "jane@example.com"]

def invite(invitee) =
  Form() >f>
  f.addPart(DateTimeRangesField("times",
    "When are you available for a meeting?", during, 9, 17)) >>
  f.addPart(Button("submit", "Submit")) >>
  SendForm(f) >receiver>
  SendMail(invitee, "Meeting Request", receiver.getURL()) >>
  receiver.get() >response>
  response.get("times")

def notify([]) =
  each(invitees) >invitee>
  SendMail(invitee, "Meeting Request Failed",
                    "No meeting time found.")
def notify(first:_) =
  each(invitees) >invitee>
  SendMail(invitee, "Meeting Request Succeeded",
                    first.getStart())

map(invite, invitees) >responses>
afold(lambda (a,b) = a.intersect(b), responses) >times>
notify(times)]]></programlisting>

<para>
This program begins with declarations of <code>during</code> (the date range for the
proposed meeting) and <code>invitees</code> (the list of people to invite represented
by email addresses).
</para>

<para>
The <code>invite</code> function obtains possible meeting times from a given invitee, as
follows.  First it uses library sites (<code>Form</code>, <code>DateTimeRangesField</code>,
<code>Button</code>, and <code>SendForm</code>) to construct a web form which may be used to
submit possible meeting times.  Then it emails the URL of this form to the
invitee and blocks waiting for a response.  When the invitee receives the
email, he or she will use a web browser to visit the URL, complete the form,
and submit it.  The corresponding execution of <code>invite</code> receives the
response in the variable <code>response</code> and extracts the chosen meeting times.
</para>

<para>
The <code>notify</code> function takes a list of possible meeting times, selects the
first meeting time in the list, and emails everyone with this time.  If the
list of possible meeting times is empty, it emails everyone indicating that no
meeting time was found.
</para>

<para>
The goal expression of the program uses the library function <code>map</code> to
apply <code>notify</code> to each invitee and collect the responses in a list. It
then uses the library function <code>afold</code> to intersect all of the responses.
The result is a set of meeting times which are acceptable to everyone. Finally,
<code>notify</code> is called to select one of these times and notify everyone of the result.
</para>

<para>
This program may be extended to add more sophisticated features, such as a
quorum (to select a meeting as soon as some subset of invitees responds) or
timeouts (to remind invitees if they don't respond in a timely manner).  These
modifications are local and do not affect the overall structure of the program.

<chapter id="chapter.services"><title>Accessing and Creating External Services</title>

<section id="section.services.intro"><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
There are two primary ways to create sites which can be used in Orc:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>Implement sites as regular Java classes.
	Orc programs can import and use these classes directly with the
	<code>class</code> declaration. This approach is easy for anyone
	already familiar with Java, and such sites are straightforward to share
	between Orc and Java code.  However such sites are limited in how they
	can interact with the Orc engine.
</listitem>
<listitem>Implement sites using Orc's low-level site API.  Orc programs can
	import and use these sites with the <code>site</code> declaration.
	This approach provides full access to the features of the Orc engine.
	However such sites are difficult to use from Java code.
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
External services (including web services) are handled using the <link
	xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">Proxy
	pattern</link>.  A site implemented in Java (using one of the two
techniques above) must act as the local proxy for the service, translating Orc
site calls into the appropriate requests and translating responses into site
return values, halts, or errors.
</para>
</section>

<section id="section.services.java"><title><code>class</code> Sites</title>

<para>
Java classes can be imported into Orc as sites using the <link
	linkend="section.orc.class"><code>class</code> declaration</link>.
Imported classes must be in the classpath of the JVM running the Orc
interpreter.  The following sections describe in detail how such imported
classes behave in Orc programs.
</para>

<section id="section.services.java.dot"><title>Dot Operator</title>

<para>
<code>x.member</code>, where <code>x</code> evaluates to a Java class or object, is evaluated as follows:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>If <code>x</code> has one or more methods named <code>member</code>,
a "method handle" site is returned which may be called like any other Orc site.
When a method handle is actually called with arguments, the appropriate Java
method is selected and called depending on the number and type of arguments, as
described in <link linkend="section.services.java.method">Method Resolution</link>
below.</listitem>
<listitem>Otherwise, if <code>x</code> has a field named <code>member</code>,
the object's field is returned, encapsulated in a <link
	linkend="orc.lib.state.Ref"><code>Ref</code> object</link>. The
<code>Ref</code> object has <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> methods
which are used to get and set the value of the field.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Note that no distinction is made between static and non-static members; it is
an error to reference a non-static member through a class, but this does not
change how members are resolved.  Note also that if a field shares a name with
one or more methods, there is no way to access the field directly.
</para>

<para>
The following (rather useless) example illustrates how the dot operator can be
used to access both static and non-static methods and fields:
<programlisting>
{- bind Integer to a Java class -}
class Integer = java.lang.Integer

{- call a static method -}
val i = Integer.decode("5")
{- read a field -}
val m = Integer.MIN_VALUE.read()
{- write a field -}
Integer.MIN_VALUE.write(5) >>
{- call a non-static method -}
i.toString()
</programlisting>
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Direct Calls</title>

<para>
When <code>x</code> evaluates to a Java object (but not a Java class), the syntax
<code>x(...)</code> is equivalent to <code>x.apply(...)</code>.
</para>

<para>
When <code>x</code> evaluates to a Java class, the syntax <code>x(...)</code>
calls the class's constructor.  In case of overloaded constructors, the
appropriate constructor is chosen based on the number and types of arguments as
described in <link linkend="section.services.java.method">Method Resolution</link>.
</para>

</section>

<section id="section.services.java.method"><title>Method Resolution</title>

<para>
When a method handle is called, the actual Java method called is chosen based
on the runtime types of the arguments, as follows:
<orderedlist>
<listitem>If only one method has the appropriate number of arguments, that method is called.</listitem>
<listitem>Otherwise, each method taking the appropriate number of arguments is
	tested for type compatibility as follows, and the first matching method
	is called.
	<orderedlist>
	<listitem>Every argument is compared to the corresponding formal
		parameter type as follows. All arguments must match for the
		method to match.
		<orderedlist>
		<listitem>If the argument is null, then the argument matches</listitem>
		<listitem>If the formal parameter type is primitive (int, char,
			float, ...) and the argument is an instance of a
			wrapper class, then the argument is unboxed (unwrapped)
			and coerced to the type of the formal parameter
			according to Java's standard rules for implicit
			widening coercions.</listitem>
		<listitem>If the formal parameter type is a primitive numeric type
			and the argument is an instance of <code language="java">BigDecimal</code>,
			the argument is implicitly narrowed to the formal parameter type.</listitem>
		<listitem>If the formal parameter type is a primitive integral type
			and the argument is an instance of <code language="java">BigInteger</code>,
			the argument is implicitly narrowed to the formal parameter type.</listitem>
		<listitem>Otherwise, the argument must be a subtype of the formal parameter type.</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
	</listitem>
	</orderedlist>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
The reason for the unusual implicit narrowing of <code language="java">BigDecimal</code> and
<code language="java">BigInteger</code> is that Orc numeric literals have these types, and it
would be awkward to have to perform an explicit conversion every time such a
value is passed to a Java method expecting a primitive.
</para>

<para>
Currently we do not implement specificity rules for choosing the best matching
method; the first matching method (according to some unspecified order) is
chosen.  Note also that we do not support varargs methods explicitly, but
instead varargs may be passed as an array of the appropriate type.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Orc values in Java</title>

<para>
Orc values are implemented by Java objects, so in general any Orc value may be
passed to a site implemented in Java.  Standard Orc values have the following
Java types:
</para>

<variablelist>
<?dbfo list-presentation="list" term-width="6em"?>

<varlistentry><term>site</term><listitem><code language="java">orc.runtime.values.Site</code>
		<para>Currently it is not possible to directly call Orc sites from Java
code.  However if you are implementing a site yourself, you may provide methods
which can be called from Java code to invoke the behavior of the site.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</section>

<section><title>Java Values in Orc</title>

<para>
Java objects may be used directly as values anywhere in an Orc program.
Primitive Java values cannot be used directly in an Orc program, but are
automatically boxed (and unboxed) as necessary.
</para>

<para>
When both arguments of an arithmetic or comparison operator are Java numeric
types, the arguments are implicitly coerced to the widest of the two argument
types.  "Widest" is defined by the following relation, where ">" means "is
wider than": BigDecimal > Double > Float > BigInteger > Long > Integer > Short
> Byte
</para>

</section>

<section id="section.services.kilim"><title>Cooperative Scheduling and Concurrency</title>

<section><title>Overview</title>
<para>
In order to support massive concurrency efficiently in Java, Orc uses
cooperative threading.  Orc programs are broken into discrete steps which
are executed by a fixed-size thread pool.  This approach works for Orc
expressions, but the internals of an Orc site written in Java cannot be easily
broken down.  So Orc has two choices when it needs to call a local Java site:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Run the site call in a new thread.  This means site calls never
	unnecessarily block the Orc engine, but it introduces the
	potentially-unnecessary overhead of creating and context-switching
	threads.</listitem>
<listitem>Run the site call in the same thread as the Orc engine, which
is efficient and conserves thread resources but may block the engine from
making further progress until the site call finishes.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
Fortunately, in practice most Orc site calls take a short, deterministic amount
of time to complete. Of those that don't, it's usually only because they are
blocked waiting for some external event, like another site call.  In this case,
instead of blocking the site can return control to the Orc engine, asking to
be run again when the external event occurs.  In typical Java applications this
kind of non-blocking behavior is implemented using callbacks (or in its most
general form, continuation passing).  Unfortunately this creates convoluted and
verbose code: what if you need to block in the middle of a <code
	language="java">for</code> loop, for example?
</para>

<para>
<link xlink:href="http://kilim.malhar.net/">Kilim</link> resolves this issue by
allowing programmers to write code in a natural blocking style and then
rewriting the bytecode to perform a form of CPS conversion, so that instead
of blocking the code actually returns control to a scheduler. Orc supports
Kilim, allowing site authors to write sites with internal concurrency and
blocking behavior which don't use Java threads and cooperate with the Orc
engine.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Kilim Fundamentals</title>

<para>
For a full introduction to <link xlink:href="http://kilim.malhar.net/">Kilim</link>, see <link
xlink:href="http://www.malhar.net/sriram/kilim/thread_of_ones_own.pdf">A Thread of
One's Own</link>, by Sriram Srinivasan. In the following, we will cover just
enough to get you started writing Orc sites using Kilim.
</para>

<para>
Kilim introduces three key primitives:
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<code language="java">Pausable</code>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This checked exception marks methods which may block. You should never catch
this exception, and you should always declare it even if you have already
declared <code language="java">throws Exception</code> or <code
language="java">throws Throwable</code>.  In all other respects it follows the
normal rules for checked exceptions: an override can only throw it if the
superclass method throws it, and you must throw it if you call any method which
throws it.
</para>

<para>Originally Kilim used annotations to mark pausable methods. It turned
out that <command>javac</command> would sometimes manipulate code in ways which violate the
invariants regarding use of the annotation. Annotations also have the
disadvantage that the invariants on their use are not checked automatically by
tools like Eclipse.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<code language="java">Mailbox</code>
</term>
<listitem>
<para>
A multiple-producer, single-consumer queue used to communicate
between tasks. The most important methods are <code language="java">put(Object)</code>, which places an item in the
mailbox, and <code language="java">get()</code>, which blocks until the mailbox
is non-empty and then returns the first item.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
<code language="java">Task</code>
</term>
<listitem>
Kilim analogue of a <code language="java">Thread</code>. Every <code language="java">Pausable</code>
method must be run within a task. To create and run a task:

<programlisting language="java">
new Task() {
    public void execute() throws Pausable {
        // do some stuff
    }
}.start();
</programlisting>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>

<para>
Together, these primitives allow you to write highly-concurrent Java programs
in a familiar threaded style.  Under the hood, Kilim can schedule any number of
concurrent tasks on a fixed number of physical threads, providing better
scalability and performance than possible with Java threads.
</para>

<para>
When writing Orc sites you rarely need to use tasks explicitly because every Orc
site call is implicitly run inside a Kilim task if necessary. Therefore all you need to do is mark
<code language="java">Pausable</code> methods. Here's a short example of a
buffer site written using Kilim <code language="java">Mailbox</code>es:

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public class KilimBuffer<V> {
	private LinkedList<Mailbox<V>> waiters =
		new LinkedList<Mailbox<V>>();
	private LinkedList<V> buffer = new LinkedList<V>();
	public synchronized void put(V o) {
		Mailbox<V> waiter = waiters.poll();
		if (waiter != null) waiter.putnb(o);
		else buffer.add(o);
	}
	public synchronized V get() throws Pausable {
		V out = buffer.poll();
		if (out != null) return out;
		else {
			Mailbox<V> waiter = new Mailbox<V>();
			waiters.add(waiter);
			return waiter.get();
		}
	}
}]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>Classes using Kilim can be imported like other Java classes using the Orc
<code>class</code> declaration.  For example, we can use the
<code language="java">KilimBuffer</code> class defined above:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
class Buffer = orc.lib.state.KilimBuffer
val b = Buffer()
  Rtimer(1000) >> b.put("1 second later") >> null
| b.get()]]></programlisting>
</para>

<warning>
The version of Kilim bundled with Orc does not support calls to pausable
methods in constructor arguments. For example, this does not work:
<programlisting language="java">
new Foo(bar.pausable());
</programlisting>
The workaround is to use a temporary variable:
<programlisting language="java">
Object tmp = bar.pausable();
new Foo(tmp);
</programlisting>
</warning>

</section>

<section><title>When you must block</title>

<para>
Sometimes blocking is unavoidable, for example if a site must perform blocking
IO.  For such cases, Orc provides a utility method <code
language="java">orc.runtime.Kilim#runThreaded(Callable)</code> which farms work
out to a thread pool.  The advantage of doing this over spawning your own
thread is that there is no chance of using too many threads; if no thread is
available, the method pauses until one becomes available.  The disadvantage is
that if you have too many Java methods which must communicate with each other
concurrently and can't use Mailboxes, there won't be enough threads for them
all and execution will deadlock.  This situation is sufficiently rare that
<code language="java">runThreaded</code> is usually the correct approach.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Compiling Kilim Sites</title>

<para>
Code which uses Kilim must be processed with the Kilim "weaver" after compiling
and before running.  The weaver is bundled with the Orc source code, or may be
downloaded separately from the <link
	xlink:href="http://www.malhar.net/sriram/kilim/">Kilim project
	site</link>.
</para>

<para>
To process compiled classes, run <code language="java">kilim.tools.Weaver</code>.
If your <filename>.class</filename> files are in the
<filename>build/</filename> directory, you would run the weaver like this:
<command>java -cp kilim.jar:build/ kilim.tools.Weaver -d build/ build/</command>
</para>

<para>
The Orc source distribution includes an ant <command>kilim</command>
task (in <filename>build.xml</filename>) which weaves compiled classes in the
<filename>build</filename> directory.  If you are compiling Orc in Eclipse, an
Eclipse "Builder" is included which does this automatically whenever any source
files change.
</para>
</section>

</section>

</section>

<section><title><code>site</code> Sites</title>

<section><title>Fundamentals</title>

<para>
Orc sites imported with the <code>site</code> declaration are implemented as
Java classes which extend <code language="java">orc.runtime.sites.Site</code>.
Here we will summarize the most important features of this and related classes;
for a detailed description, refer to the <link
xlink:href="http://orc.csres.utexas.edu/javadoc/STABLE/index.html">Javadoc</link>.
</para>

<para>
Sites must implement a single method: <code language="java">callSite(Args args,
Token token)</code>.  The Orc engine calls this method whenever the site is
called by the Orc program.
</para>

<para>
The <code language="java">args</code> argument (of type <code
language="java">Args</code>) is used to get the arguments which were passed to
the site call by the Orc program. It has the following important methods:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><code language="java">getArg(int
n)</code></term><listitem>returns the value of the (n+1)th argument, as an
<code language="java">Object</code>.  For example, to get the value of the
first argument, call <code
language="java">args.getArg(0)</code>.</listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><code language="java">intArg(int n)</code>, <code
language="java">stringArg(int n)</code>, <code language="java">boolArg(int
n)</code>, etc.</term><listitem>returns the value of the (n+1)th argument cast
to the appropriate type. If the argument is not the appropriate type, throws an
<code
language="java">ArgumentTypeMismatchException</code>.</listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
The <code language="java">token</code> argument (of type <code
language="java">Token</code>) is a sort of callback which is used by the site
to return a value or signal that it has halted. It has the following important
methods:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><code language="java">resume(Object
value)</code></term><listitem>return the value <code
language="java">value</code> from the site call. For example, to return the
number 5, call <code language="java">token.resume(5)</code>.  To publish a
signal without returning any specific value, call <code
language="java">token.resume()</code>.</listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><code language="java">error(TokenException
problem)</code></term><listitem>halt without publishing a value and report an
error.  This method is an appropriate way to report Java exceptions encountered
during a site call.  Alternatively, a site can simply throw a checked exception
from the <code language="java">callSite</code> method; the engine will call
<code language="java">token.error</code> on its behalf. To convert a Java
exception to the necessary <code language="java">TokenException</code> type,
wrap it in an instance of <code
language="java">orc.error.runtime.JavaException</code>.</listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><code language="java">die()</code></term><listitem>halt,
without publishing a value or reporting an error. For example, the built-in
site <code>if</code> uses this method to halt when called with a
<code>false</code> argument.</listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
The <code language="java">callSite</code> method must return control to its
caller within a short, deterministic amount of time.  To implement a site which
blocks or waits for some condition, <code language="java">callSite</code> must
save the <code language="java">token</code> and return without calling any of
the above methods.  Then when it is time for the site call to return, call the
appropriate method on the <code language="java">token</code>.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>More Site Classes</title>

<section><title>EvalSite</title>

<para>
Many sites are deterministic, always returning a value immediately when called.
Such sites can be implemented easily by extending <code
language="java">orc.runtime.sites.EvalSite</code> and implementing the method
<code language="java">evaluate(Args args)</code>.  This method should read the
arguments from <code language="java">args</code> as usual, and then return the
value to be returned from the site call, or throw a checked exception to
indicate an error.
</para>
</section>

<section id="section.services.sites.ThreadedSite"><title>ThreadedSite</title>

<para>
Some sites need to perform blocking IO or use other Java blocking methods like
<code language="java">Object#wait()</code>.  This cannot be done directly in
the <code language="java">callSite</code> or <code
language="java">EvalSite#evaluate</code>  methods because that might block the
Orc engine. Instead, extend <code
language="java">orc.runtime.sites.ThreadedSite</code> and implement the method
<code language="java">evaluate(Args args)</code>.  This method should read the
arguments from <code language="java">args</code> as usual, and then return the
value to be returned from the site call, or throw a checked exception to
indicate an error.  Your <code language="java">evaluate</code> method will be
automatically run asynchronously in a new thread so that it does not interfere
with the Orc engine.
</para>

<para>
Beware that the Orc engine may be configured to only allow a fixed number of
site threads. If too many sites need to use threads simultaneously, some will
block until threads become available.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>DotSite</title>

<para>
Recall that the notation <code>x.msg</code> corresponds to calling the site
<code>x</code> with the special message value <code>msg</code>.  To implement a
site which responds to such messages, extend <code
language="java">orc.runtime.sites.DotSite</code>.
</para>

<para>
In your site's constructor, call the method <code
language="java">addMember(String message, Object value)</code> once for each
message you wish the site to respond to. The call <code
language="java">addMember(m, v)</code> instructs the site to return the value
<code language="java">v</code> when it is called with the message <code
language="java">m</code>.
</para>

<para>
Any object can be used as a member value, even another site.  Anonymous inner
classes extending <code language="java">Site</code> are often used as member
values which behave like  methods of the enclosing <code
language="java">DotSite</code>.
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section><title>Tutorial Example</title>

<para>
We will implement a simplified version of Orc's <code>Buffer</code> site,
called <code language="java">ExampleBuffer</code>. The goal will be to be able
to run this Orc program:
</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
-- Import the site definition
site ExampleBuffer = ExampleBuffer
-- Create a new buffer site
val b = ExampleBuffer()
-- wait for a value in the buffer
b.get()
-- put a value in the buffer
| b.put(3) >> stop
-- Publishes: 3]]></programlisting>

<para>
The first step is to create <filename>ExampleBuffer.java</filename>. The <code
language="java">ExampleBuffer</code> site is actually a <firstterm>discovery site</firstterm>: all
it does when called is create and return a reference to a new site (the buffer
instance).
</para>

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
public class ExampleBuffer extends EvalSite {
  public Object evaluate(Args args) {
    return new ExampleBufferInstance();
  }
}]]></programlisting>

<para>
Next we must implement <code language="java">ExampleBufferInstance</code>,
which defines the behavior of an individual buffer. We can put this class
either in its own file or in <filename>ExampleBuffer.java</filename>, since
that is the only class which refers to it directly. How does an instance
behave? If we write <code>b.get()</code>, that means that <code>b</code>
responds to the message <code>get</code> with a site which we call to get a
value from the buffer. So we'll extend <code language="java">DotSite</code>,
telling it to respond to the message "get" with a <code
language="java">GetMethod</code> site, and likewise for "put". We'll use a
linked list to store the actual contents of the buffer.
</para>

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
class ExampleBufferInstance extends DotSite {
  private LinkedList<Object> contents = new LinkedList<Object>();
  public ExampleBufferInstance() {
    addMember("get", new GetMethod());
    addMember("put", new PutMethod());
  }
}]]></programlisting>

<para>
The <code language="java">GetMethod</code> site is implemented as an inner
class so it has easy access to the contents of the buffer. In the
implementation we first check if there is an item in the buffer. If so, we
return it. Otherwise, we must store the token in a queue to be notified when
the next item is put in the buffer. We synchronize on the outer object to
protect against concurrent modification.
</para>

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
private LinkedList<Token> waiters = new LinkedList<Token>();
private class GetMethod extends Site {
  public void callSite(Args args, Token token) {
    synchronized (ExampleBufferInstance.this) {
      if (!contents.isEmpty()) {
        token.resume(contents.removeFirst());
      } else {
        waiters.add(token);
      } 
    }
  }
}]]></programlisting>

<para>
<code language="java">PutMethod</code> is even simpler since it doesn't need to
block. If there is a token waiting for an item, we give it the item. Otherwise
we put the item in the buffer. We synchronize on the outer object to protect
against concurrent modification. When done we return a dummy "signal" value.
</para>

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
private class PutMethod extends EvalSite {
  public Object evaluate(Args args) {
    Object item = args.getArg(0);
    synchronized (ExampleBufferInstance.this) { 
      if (!waiters.isEmpty()) {
        waiters.removeFirst().resume(item);
      } else {
        contents.add(item);
      } 
    }
    return signal();
  }
}]]></programlisting>

<para>
Putting it all together, here is the entire implementation:
</para>

<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
import java.util.LinkedList;

import orc.runtime.sites.EvalSite;
import orc.runtime.sites.DotSite;
import orc.runtime.sites.Site;
import orc.runtime.Token;

public class ExampleBuffer extends EvalSite {
  public Object evaluate(Args args) {
    return new ExampleBufferInstance();
  }
}

class ExampleBufferInstance extends DotSite {
  private LinkedList<Object> contents = new LinkedList<Object>();
  private LinkedList<Token> waiters = new LinkedList<Token>();
    
  private class GetMethod extends Site {
    public void callSite(Args args, Token token) {
      synchronized (ExampleBufferInstance.this) {
        if (!contents.isEmpty()) {
          token.resume(contents.removeFirst());
        } else {
          waiters.add(token);
        } 
      }
    }
  }

  private class PutMethod extends EvalSite {
    public Object evaluate(Args args) {
      Object item = args.getArg(0);
      synchronized (ExampleBufferInstance.this) { 
        if (!waiters.isEmpty()) {
          waiters.removeFirst().resume(item);
        } else {
          contents.add(item);
        } 
      }
      return signal();
    }
  }

  public ExampleBufferInstance() {
    addMember("get", new GetMethod());
    addMember("put", new PutMethod());
  }
}]]></programlisting>

<section><title>Web Services</title>

<section><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
While we believe Orc is an excellent language for web service scripting,
currently the library support for such tasks is at a proof-of-concept level.
The web service libraries are not bundled with the core Orc distribution, do
not have stable APIs, and are not officially documented.  However this section
should provide you with enough information to get started.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Downloading and Running Examples</title>

<para>All Orc sites related to web services are bundled in a separate
"OrcSites" library.  As with the core Orc distribution, you can either
download this library as a prepackaged JAR or check out the
source code from the "OrcSites" module in version control.  We generally recommend the latter
approach, since the source code provides several examples which can be used as
a basis for creating your own web service sites.
</para>

<para>
Within the OrcSites source code you will find:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Java source code for web service sites: <filename>src/orc/lib/net/</filename></listitem>
<listitem>Orc source code for programs using web services: <filename>examples/</filename></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Several of the examples require you to create
	<filename>.properties</filename> files and place them in your
	classpath. The simplest way to do this is to make sure the
	<filename>examples/</filename> directory is in your classpath, and
	place the necessary <filename>.properties</filename> files there.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Protocols Supported</title>

<para>
Web services use a variety of protocols, so there are a variety of ways to
contact them. All of them boil down to creating a Java proxy site for the
service and calling that.  Previous sections explain how to implement such Java
sites which can be called in Orc. Because web services tend to use blocking
I/O, Java wrappers make frequent use of <link linkend="section.services.sites.ThreadedSite">ThreadedSite</link> and
<link linkend="section.services.kilim">Kilim</link> to ensure that web service calls don't block the Orc engine.
</para>

<section><title>Java APIs</title>

<para>
Some web services provide Java APIs specifically for the service. For example,
Google Calendar. In these cases we just use the Java API from Orc, either
directly or via a small Java wrapper which simplifies the interface.
</para>

<para>OrcSites includes <code>class orc.lib.net.GoogleCalendar</code> as an
	example of this type of web service.</para>

</section>

<section><title>SOAP RPC</title></section>

<para>
OrcSites includes a generic <code>site orc.lib.net.Webservice</code> which allows you to connect to any SOAP RPC (specifically
rpc/encoded) service, without writing Java wrappers.  Instead <link
	xlink:href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Apache Axis</link> is used to
generate Java wrappers on-demand.
</para>

<para>
<link xlink:href="http://www.xmethods.net" /> is a good place to find examples
of SOAP RPC services:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>Find the RPC "Style" service which does what you want.</listitem>
<listitem>Click on the name of the service.</listitem>
<listitem>Click on "View RPC Profile" for a summary of the methods available.</listitem>
<listitem>Construct instances of the service by passing the WSDL URL to the
	<code>Webservice</code> site. E.g. <code>Webservice("http://site.com/wsdl")</code>.</listitem>
<listitem>Call methods on the service as you would with any Java object. The
	<link xlink:href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=101">JAX-RPC
		specification</link> has complete details on how SOAP
	operations and data types are represented in Java.  Beware: method
	names always begin with a lower-case letter, even if the corresponding
	operation does not.</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
Example:
</para>
<programlisting language="orc-demo">
site orc.lib.net.Webservice
{-
Find documentation of this service at:
http://www.xmethods.net/ve2/WSDLRPCView.po?
key=uuid:BF3EFCDD-FCD4-8867-3AAC-068985E7CB89
-}
val service = Webservice(
  "http://www.ebob42.com/cgi-bin/"
  + "Romulan.exe/wsdl/IRoman")
service.intToRoman(451)
</programlisting>

</section>

<section><title>REST</title>

<para>
Many services use ad-hoc REST/XML protocols. Unfortunately, there is no REST
equivalent to WSDL, so there's no way to automatically generate an API for REST
services. We're not trying to solve this problem with Orc, but when the web
services community reaches some kind of consensus, Orc will support it.
</para>

<para>
For now you must write a Java wrapper for each service which handles
marshalling and unmarshalling the data. There's no reason such marshalling code
couldn't be written in Orc, calling low-level HTTP and XML libraries directly,
but there would be no advantage to doing so, so we let each language play to
its strengths. OrcSites includes utility classes to assist with submitting
requests and parsing responses.</para>

<para>OrcSites includes the following examples of this type of service:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><code>class orc.lib.net.Upcoming</code></listitem>
<listitem><code>site orc.lib.net.TrueRandom</code></listitem>
<listitem><code>site orc.lib.net.YahooSpellFactory</code></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</appendix>

<appendix id="appendix.library"><title>Standard Library</title>
<section><title>Overview</title>
<para>
The standard library is a set of declarations implicitly available to all Orc
programs.  In this section we give an informal description of the standard library,
including the type of each declaration and a short explanation of its use.
</para>

<para>
Orc programs are expected to rely on the host language and environment for
all but the most essential sites.  For example, in the Java implementation of
Orc, the entire Java standard library is available to Orc programs via
<code>class</code> declarations. Therefore the Orc standard library aims only
to provide convenience for the most common Orc idioms, not the complete set of
features needed for general-purpose programming.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Notation</title>

<para>
Each declaration in the standard library includes a type signature as part of
its documentation. The notation for type signatures, summarized here, is based
on a formal type system for Orc currently under preparation.
</para>

<para>
A type signature consists of: a declaration keyword, a declaration name,
type parameters (with subtyping constraints), formal argument types,
and finally the return type. For example <code>def min[A &lt;: Comparable](A,
	A) :: A</code> gives the type of the <code>def</code> declaration for
<code>min</code>. According to this signature, <code>min</code> is a function
parameterized over any type <code>A</code> which is a subtype of
<code>Comparable</code>. It takes two arguments of type <code>A</code> and
returns a value of the same type.
</para>

<para>
Declaration keywords include
<link linkend="orc-declaring-a-site"><code>site</code></link> and
<link linkend="cor.functions"><code>def</code></link>.  These
declaration keywords are described in previous chapters.</para>

<para>
The declaration name is the name of a function, site, or object member.
Member names are written in the form Type.member, e.g.  <code>Foo.get</code>
refers to the <code>get</code> member of an object of type <code>Foo</code>.
The object type can include type variables which are referenced by the member
type, so for example <code>site Buffer[A].get() :: A</code> means that
when the <code>get</code> method is called on a <code>Buffer</code> holding an
arbitrary element type <code>A</code>, it will return a value of the same type.
</para>

<para>
Polymorphic sites and functions are declared with explicit type parameters.
By convention, the type parameters are written using the letters <code>A</code>
... <code>Z</code>. For example, the signature <code>site let[A](A) :: A</code>
means that <code>let</code> takes one argument of any type, and returns a value
of the same type.  Subtyping constraints can be used to constrain the type
parameters. A constrained type parameter has the form <code>A &lt;: X</code>,
meaning the type supplied for <code>A</code> must be a subtype of <code>X</code>.
</para>

<para>
Argument and return types are written as follows:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Primitive types are given descriptive names based on the names of the
	corresponding Java classes. For example, <code>Number</code> is any
	number, and <code>Comparable</code> is any value which supports a total
	order.</listitem> 
<listitem>The Top type (the type of <code>signal</code>, of which all types are subtypes) is written
	<code>Top</code>. The Bottom type (the type of <code>halt</code>, and a subtype of all types) is
	written <code>Bot</code>.</listitem>
<listitem>A tuple with element types <code>A, B, ...</code> is written <code>(A, B, ...)</code>.</listitem>
<listitem>Any other parameterized type is written as a type name followed by
	type parameters in square brackets. For example, <code>List[String]</code>
	is the type of a list of strings, and <code>Array[Integer]</code> is the type
	of arrays of integers.</listitem>
<listitem>A function type (when given as an argument or return type) is written with the keyword
	<code>lambda</code> followed by the argument types and return type as
	in a declaration type signature. For example, <code>lambda (Integer) ::
	Integer</code> is the type of functions mapping integers to
	integers.</listitem>

<para>
Multiple sets of argument types are syntactic sugar for currying. For
example, <code>site Foo()() :: Top</code> is equivalent to
<code>site Foo() :: lambda () :: Top</code>.
