<title>Expressions</title>

<para>
	Orc <indexterm><primary>expression</primary></indexterm>expressions are executed, rather than evaluated.
	An execution may call external services and publish some number of values (possibly zero).
	Different executions of the same expression may have completely different
	behaviors; they may call different services, may receive different
	responses from the same site, and may publish different values.  This
	chapter shows how various expressions are executed in Orc.
