<title>Expressions</title>

<para>
	Orc language has a functional subset, called Cor.  Any expression in the
	functional subset always yields the same result whenever it is evaluated.  Orc
	expressions are executed, rather than evaluated; an execution may call
	external services and publish some number of values (possibly zero).
	Different executions of the same expression may have completely different
	behaviors; they may call different services, may receive different
	responses from the same site, and may publish different values.  This
	chapter shows how various expressions are executed within Orc.
