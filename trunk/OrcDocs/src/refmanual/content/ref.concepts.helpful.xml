	<title>Helpful Sites</title>

		<para>
			A call to a <link linkend="ref.sites">site</link>, from the site's perspective, has three possible
			outcomes: the site will definitely publish a value, the site knows
			that it will never publish a value, and the site does not know if it
			will ever publish a value. For example, a call to <code>Ift(true)</code> publishes a signal,
			<code>Ift(false)</code> never publishes, and <code>c.get()</code> on channel <code>c</code> that is currently
			empty may eventually publish or remain non-responsive, depending on whether a
			value is put in <code>c</code> in the future.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			All sites respond with a value when they publish. A <firstterm>helpful</firstterm> site,
			additionally, responds with an indication that it will never publish
			when it knows this outcome. All library sites in Orc are
			helpful. Thus, <code>Ift</code> is a helpful site, and <code>Ift(false)</code> sends an
			indication to the caller that it will never publish. A <link linkend="ref.stdlib.state.Buffer">buffer</link> is a
			helpful site, and some of its methods will send an indication that
			they will never publish. Note that <code>get</code> method on a buffer never
			sends an indication that will not publish, because it can not
			definitely determine this outcome; this outcome depends on whether
			some caller <code>put</code>s an item in the buffer eventually. Thus, <code>get</code> may
			be blocked permanently.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			We do not expect arbitrary web services to be helpful. The indication
			from a helpful site that it will never publish can be exploited in the
			caller using the <link linkend="ref.combinators.otherwise">otherwise combinator</link>.
