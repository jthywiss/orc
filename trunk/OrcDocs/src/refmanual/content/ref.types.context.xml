	<title>Typing Contexts</title>

  <para>
  Whenever one or more variables is bound, the type checker records information from that
  binding to typecheck the uses of that variable in its scope. This information is stored
  in a <firstterm>typing context</firstterm>, which is just a sequence of variable names and
  their types. When an expression in the scope of many declarations is typechecked, the
  typechecker will carry a composite context of all of the typing contexts created by all
  of the declarations. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
  Most declarations bind only a single variable and simply add one binding to the typing
  context. However, pattern matching may generate a whole sequence of variable bindings.
  </para>
  
  <para>
  When a variable is typechecked, its type is found by first looking in the most recent 
  context (i.e. from the nearest declaration), and if its type is not found there, proceeding
  further and further out in scope. If the variable is not in the typing context, then it
  is a free variable, which is a syntactic error.
