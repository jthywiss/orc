<title>Patterns</title>

<para>
A pattern describes a set of values and may bind variables to their components. 
Patterns are used in <code>val</code> declarations, in combinators, and in clausal definitions of functions. 
</para>

<para>
A pattern is given by a shape and a set of variables. A shape is either a tuple, a list, a record, a call, a literal value,
or wildcard (written as <code>_</code>). If the shape describes a structured value (such as a tuple), its components may
also be shapes. For example, the shape <code>(_,3)</code> describes all pairs whose second element is <code>3</code>, 
and the pattern <code>(x,3)</code> binds <code>x</code> to the first element of all such pairs.      
</para>

<para>
A pattern such as <code>(x,y)</code> may bind multiple variables. 
However, patterns are <firstterm>linear</firstterm>, meaning that a pattern may mention a variable name at most once. 
For example, <code>(x,y,x)</code> is not a valid pattern.
</para>

<para>
Note that a pattern may fail to match a value, if it does not have the same shape as that value.
When this occurs, the unmatched value is simply discarded, as if it had never been published.
