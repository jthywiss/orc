<title>Expressions</title>

<para>
As in Cor, an Orc program is an expression; Orc expressions are built up recursively from smaller
expressions. Orc is a superset of Cor, i.e., all Cor expressions are also Orc expressions. Orc expressions are
executed, rather than evaluated; an execution may call external services and publish some number of values
(possibly zero). Different executions of the same expression may have completely different behaviors; they
may call different services, may receive different responses from the same site, and may publish different
values. Expressions in the functional subset, though, will display the same behavior in all executions.
