A <code>class</code> is an abstraction mechanism in Orc, much like the
<code>def</code> construct. It extends the <code>def</code> construct, by allowing
us to convert an Orc program fragment into a site. Specifically, a
class can be used to: (1) Define object classes with methods,
(2) Create new sites and extend behaviors of existing sites, (3) Allow
concurrent method invocation on objects, and (4) Create active
objects, whose executions may be based on time or other external
stimulus, not necessarily explicitly called methods.

<para>
A class has the following properties:
<orderedlist>
<listitem>Encapsulation: Just like objects in an object-oriented language, classes 
	also provide the encapsulation facility for the programmer. The data defined inside 
	the class can only be accessed and modified through methods defined in class. Therefore, 
	it hides the representation of the data and implementation of functions and methods 
	which work on the data and manage the state. </listitem>
<listitem>Methods instead of functions: These are the gateways to access and manipulate the 
	data represented by class. They also enable the user of the class to access the service 
	provided by that. Unlike functions in Orc, methods defined in a class can only publish 
	one value. </listitem>
<listitem>Termination protection: The execution of a class and its methods are protected from 
	termination of the rest of the program. In other words, the execution of class cannot be 
	interrupted. In the pruning combinator as soon as the right hand side expression publishes a 
	value, all the on going executions in the right hand side will be terminated. However, if there 
	is any call to a class in the right hand side, that call will proceed until completion. For 
	example, in the following Orc expression, suppose that c is a class.
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
	 y <y< g() | c() 
]]></programlisting>
	If g() publishes a value before c() does, the execution of c() will continue. Although, the published 
	value of c() (if any) will never be used. On the other hand, if c() publishes a value first, then the 
	execution of g() will be interrupted since its execution is not protected. This property of classes is 
	very important to prevent the data corruption and invalid state of an object. We will see using an 
	example the significance of this property later on in the guide. 
</listitem>
	<listitem>Strict calls: unlike calls to ordinary function definitions in Orc, calls to class methods 
		are strict. This means that the call will not happen unless all the parameters are bound. </listitem>
</orderedlist>
