<title>Time</title>

<para>
Orc is designed to communicate with the external world, and one of the
most important characteristics of the external world is the passage of
time. Orc implicitly interacts with the passage of time by calling external
services which take time to respond. However, Orc can also explicitly
wait for some amount of time, using the special site <code>Rtimer</code>.
