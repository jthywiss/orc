<title>Sites and Services</title>

<para>
Orc programs communicate with their environment by calling <firstterm>sites</firstterm>.
These sites perform services, which the Orc program orchestrates.
A site call may return a value, or may be silent, returning no value.
</para>

<para>
Orc has no built-in services, so even operations as simple as addition are performed by sites.
Sites may also provide complex services, such as a database management system.
</para>

<para>
Sites may be provided by various types of software components, such as Java classes, Web services, or custom
Orc sites.  The site call interface, however, is uniform across these types.
