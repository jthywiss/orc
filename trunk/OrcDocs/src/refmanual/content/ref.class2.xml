      <para>
      	Class is an abstraction mechanism in Orc, much like function. It
		allows a programmer to code a site in Orc. More generally, a class can
		be used to: (1) Define object classes with methods, (2) Create new
		sites and extend behaviors of existing sites, (3) Allow concurrent
		method invocation on objects, and (4) Create active objects, whose
		executions may be based on time or other external stimulus, not
		necessarily explicitly called methods.

		  <para> 
		  	The keyword <code>class</code> denotes that a class is being defined, not just a
			function.  A class definition may have parameters like a function
			definition. In particular, a class or class instance could be a parameter.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  	The body of a class may include definitions of both functions and
			classes. The name of every definition in the body is exported to the
			surrounding scope as a dot method. A class body must include at least
			one definition, which could be a function or a class.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  	A class may be defined as a set of clauses. In that case, each clausal
			body must include the definitions of the same set of functions and
			classes.

	  	<title>Matrix Definition</title>
	  	<para>
	  		Orc's standard library supports only one dimensional arrays, and array
			indices always start at 0. We define a 2-dimensional Matrix whose
			row and column indices range over an arbitrary interval.
	  	</para>
	  	<example xml:id="ref.class2.semantics.examples.one"><title>Matrix Definition</title>

def class Matrix((rowlo, rowhi), (collo, colhi)) =
 val mat = Array((rowhi - rowlo + 1) * (colhi - collo + 1))

 def access(i, j) = mat((i - rowlo) * (colhi - collo + 1) + j)

val A = Matrix((-2, 0), (-1, 3)).access
A(-1, 2) := 5 >> A(-1, 2) := 3 >> A(-1, 2)?
]]></programlisting>
		  </example>
		  <para>
		  	Note: We have defined <code>A</code> as the "access" method of the defined
			matrix. This allows us to retrive and update the matrix elements using
			traditional notation.
		  </para>
		  </section>
		  <section>
		  <title>Create a Site</title>
		  <para>
		  	We create a site, <code>Cell</code>, that defines a write-once variable. It
			supports two methods: <code>read</code> blocks until the variable has been
			written, and then it returns its value; <code>write(v)</code> blocks forever if a value has
			already been written, otherwise it writes <code>v</code> as the value and
			publishes a <code>signal</code>.
		  </para>
		  <para>
		  	We use two library sites, <code>Semaphore</code> (to ensure blocking of write if a
			value has been written) and <code>Ref</code> to store the value.

		  <example xml:id="ref.class2.semantics.examples.two"><title>Create a Site</title>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def class Cell() =

		  <section>
		  <title>Extend Functionality of an Existing Site</title>
		  <para>
		  	The <code>Buffer</code> site implements an unbounded channel. We add a new method,
			"length", that returns the number of items in the channel. We have to
			assign a name different from "Buffer", "Channel", to this class.
		  </para>
		  <example xml:id="ref.class2.semantics.examples.three"><title>Extend Functionality of an Existing Site</title>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def class Channel() =
 val ch = Buffer()
 val chlen = Counter(0)

 def length() = chlen.value()

		  <section>
		  <title>Managing Concurrent Access</title>
		  <para>
		  	The methods of a class instance may be executed concurrently through
			concurrent invocations. Concurrent execution may cause interference,
			as in the example of the <code>Newset</code> example. Typically, semaphores are used to
			restrict access to methods and/or data. We rewrite <code>Newset</code> in which all
			accesses to shared data <code>ne</code> are protected using a semaphore.
		  </para>
		  <example xml:id="ref.class2.semantics.examples.four"><title>Managing Concurrent Access</title>
<programlisting language="orc-demo"><![CDATA[
def class Newset(n) =
 val b = BoundedBuffer(n)
 val (s , ne) = (semaphore(1) , Ref(0))

 {- Add an element to the set if it is non-full.
   If the set is full, wait until the set becomes non-full.
   Return a signal on completion.

 def add(x) = b.put(x) >> s.acquire() >> ne := ne? + 1 >> s.release()

 {- Remove some element from the set if it is non-empty.
   If the set is empty, wait until the set becomes non-empty.
   Return the removed value.

		  <title>Computing with the Goal Expression</title>
		  <para>
		  	All the goal expressions shown so far have been merely <code>stop</code>. In the
			following example, the goal expression of class metro initiates an
			unending computation in which <code>tick</code> is printed every second; all the
			publications of the goal expression are ignored.
