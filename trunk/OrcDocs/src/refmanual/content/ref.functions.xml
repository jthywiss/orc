<title>Functions</title>

<para>
Unlike typical mathematical functions, an Orc function may publish an
arbitrary number of values (possibly zero, possibly unbounded), it
may cause side effects (e.g., printing at the console, sending an email,
firing a missile, etc.) and its behavior may be different each time it
is run.
