<title>Combinators</title>

<para>
Orc has four combinators: parallel, sequential, pruning, and otherwise. A combinator forms an
expression from two component expressions. Each combinator captures a different aspect of concurrency.
Syntactically, the combinators are written infix, and have lower precedence than operators, but higher
precedence than conditionals or declarations.
