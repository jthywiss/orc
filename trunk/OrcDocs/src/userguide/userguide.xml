Orc is a programming language designed to make distributed and
concurrent programs simple and intuitive to write. Orc expresses
orchestration, a type of structured concurrency. It emphasizes the
flow of control and gives a global view of a concurrent system. Orc
is well-suited for task orchestration, a form of
concurrent programming with applications in workflow, business process
management, and web service orchestration. Orc provides constructs to
orchestrate the concurrent invocation of services while managing
time-outs, priorities, and failures of services or communication.  To
