<title>Datatypes</title>

<para>
We have seen Orc's predefined data structures: tuples, lists, and records. Orc also provides the capability
for programmers to define their own data structures, using a feature adopted from the ML/Haskell
language family called <firstterm>datatypes</firstterm> (also called variants or tagged sums).
</para>

<para>
Datatypes are defined using the <code>type</code> declaration:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
type Tree = Node(_,_,_) | Empty()
]]></programlisting>

</para>

<para>
This declaration defines two new sites named <code>Node</code> and <code>Empty</code>.
<code>Node</code> takes three arguments, and publishes a <emphasis>tagged value</emphasis>
wrapping those arguments. <code>Empty</code> takes no arguments and does the same.
</para>

<para>
Once we have created these tagged values, we use a new pattern called a datatype pattern
to match them and unwrap the arguments:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
type Tree = Node(_,_,_) | Empty()
{- Build up a small binary tree -}
val l = Node(Empty(), 0, Empty())
val r = Node(Empty(), 2, Empty())
val t = Node(l,1,r)

{- And then match it to extract its contents -}
t >Node(l,j,r)>
l >Node(_,i,_)>
r >Node(_,k,_)>
( i | j | k )
]]></programlisting>
</para>

<para>
One pair of datatypes is so commonly used that it is already predefined in the standard library:
<code>Some(_)</code> and <code>None()</code>. These are used as return values for calls that
need to distinguish between successfully returning a value (<code>Some(v)</code>), and successfully
completing but having no meaningful value to return (<code>None()</code>). For example, a lookup
function might return <code>Some(result)</code> if it found a result, or return <code>None()</code>
if it successfully performed the lookup but found no suitable result.
</para>
