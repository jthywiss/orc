	abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The widespread deployment of networked applications and adoption of the internet has fostered an environment in which many distributed services are available. There is great demand to automate business processes and workflows among organizations and individuals. Solutions to such problems require orchestration of concurrent and distributed services in the face of arbitrary delays and failures of components and communication. We propose a novel approach, called Orc for orchestration, that supports a structured model of concurrent and distributed programming. This model assumes that basic services, like sequential computation and data manipulation, are implemented by primitive sites. Orc provides constructs to orchestrate the concurrent invocation of sites to achieve a goal \^{a}?? while managing time-outs, priorities, and failure of sites or communication.},
