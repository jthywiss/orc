	Abstract = {Orc is a new language for task orchestration, a form of concurrent programming with applications in workflow, business process management, and web service orchestration. Orc provides constructs to orchestrate the concurrent invocation of services -- while managing time-outs, priorities, and failure of services or communication. In this paper, we show a trace-based semantic model for Orc, which induces a congruence on Orc programs and facilitates reasoning about them. Despite the simplicity of the language and its semantic model, Orc is able to express a variety of useful orchestration tasks.},
