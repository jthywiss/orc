{- 
   A BBtree is a balanced binary tree of depth n. An index is a list
   of 0s and 1s whose length is less than n. It identifies a node in
   the tree as follows: a 0 identifies a left branch and a 1 a right
   branch. 

   Two operations are supported: read(is) where is an index list, 
   reads the value at the specified node (given by the index) and 
   write(v,is) writes value v at the given node.
