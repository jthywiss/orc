Notes:
rand_seq() resembles a Metronome.

Definition of game() ensures that any user input causes termination of
  rand_seq() since it is a Orc function

If rand_seq() generates multiple values equal to v, sw.start() will be called
for each of them. But, beyond the first call, sw.start() has no effect.
