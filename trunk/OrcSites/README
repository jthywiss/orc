Welcome! This archive includes assorted useful sites for Orc.
See the Javadoc for more information.

These Orc sites run in a Java SE 6 runtime environment.  Required JARs
are included here, in the "lib" directory.

Examples of Orc programs using these sites are included in the
"examples" directory.

See https://orc.csres.utexas.edu/ for more information about Orc,
including the language user's guide, discussion groups, a wiki, and more.

See the files LICENSE and licenses.yml for license agreements.

See licenses.yml for information on bundled third-party libraries and code.


USING ORCSITES

To use the JAR, just include it and its dependencies in your classpath
when running Orc.  Because of some weirdness with the classloader, you
should not run Orc with the "-jar" option. Instead, run programs
with the orc.Main class, for example:

java -cp <path-to-Orc>/orc-2.0.2.jar:<path-to-Orc>/lib/\*:orc-sites-2.0.2.jar:lib/\* orc.Main examples/eliza.orc
