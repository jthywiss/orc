	/** 
	 * Creates closures encapsulating the definitions and the defining environment. 
	 * The environment for the closure is the same as the input environment, but it is extended
	 * to <it>include a binding for the definition name whose value is the closure</it>.
	 * This means that the closure environment must refer to the closure, so there
	 * is a cycle in the object pointer graph. This cycle is constructed in 
	 * three steps:
	 * <nl>
	 * <li>Create the closure with a null environment
	 * <li>Bind the name to the new closure
	 * <li>Update the closure to point to the new environment
	 * </ul>
	 * Then the next token is activated in this new environment.
	 * This is a standard technique for creating recursive closures.
	 * 
	 * Closures created in this way are protected by a PartialValue object,
	 * preventing them from being used in argument position until all unbound
	 * vars in all definition bodies become bound.
	 * 
	 * @see orc.runtime.nodes.Node#process(orc.runtime.Token, orc.runtime.OrcEngine)
