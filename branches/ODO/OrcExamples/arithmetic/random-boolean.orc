{- RandomBool() has:
   f a real number between 0 and 1,
   t an integer,
   A call to site RandomBool.main(f,t) responds with
     probability f
     after some random time at most t
     with a random boolean.
   (Note that the call just halts silently with probability 1-f.)

  It has just one method, main(). It handles one call at a time.
