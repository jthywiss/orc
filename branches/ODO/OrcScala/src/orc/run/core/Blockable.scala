/** The interface that allows Schedulables to block on Blockers and receive a value when unblocked.
  *
  * Blockables can be unblocked by any thread. This means that as soon as
  * the Blocker knows about the Blockable and the Blocker is running you
  * must assume that it could unblock at any time. So in general, blocking
  * should be the last action before returning to the scheduler.
  *
  * Blockables should not block on another Blocker in awake*(). This can 
  * cause SiteCallHandle to deadlock because SiteCallHandle holds it's monitor 
  * while calling the Blockables awake*() methods. So if you call read() or 
  * similar on another SiteCallHandle, there could be a deadlock if one
  * blockable blocks on A then B and the other B then A.
